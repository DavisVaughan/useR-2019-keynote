Title: "There is an R in teamwork" > interpersonal side of R
R for better science in less time, TOGETHER. 
1 slide per minute?


Don't give the play by play of what I am going to do showing not telling Slide 23 "I'm going to telel you about these things> don't waste airtime on what I'll say."

be deliberate about why i'm using this example: 
eg telling allison's story: tighten by not focus. what's the oint of allison's story. She's creating a place to welcome her students into R. Def touch on Allsion her artwork but focus on why I'm telling people more about allison.

Intro tighten: labs form around groups not necessary. I was in a group we studied squid but we did not work with a team. This is the tension to present in the story.

My journey for learning R: being really deliberate for learning R. it was helpful to hear a bit about grad school struggle to now, but be really delib What are theey learning
Purpose: don't go through tstep by step. cred and
right after force:: my journey for learning the force was over years but through cumulative experiences
i learned how to teach it I created places to teach it but that wasn't enough I also wrote a paper about it. TAKE OUT OHI. No context yet. And then Mozilla let me do it. 

I keep introducing a cool idea but get lost at the end of a slide. How I come to the star wars analogy. put in a dramatic pause. "....and this is how star wars is related to it". When am I going to intro something really cool: give space for it. 

Openscapes is paying it forward to people. Power of welcome. 
CHANGE LESSONS LEARNED TO PAYING IT FORWARD: it is the force
Today I'm going to pay it forward. But first I"m going to tell you what it is
Do

Openscapes is a mentorshipt program that is allowing it to pay it all forward. And I'll tell you about it as we go. 

for scientists who want to want to intro ODS to their resarch groups

Cut breakfast

Tighten OHI: ohi is a scientific endeavor where we use lots of data and need to repeat our work and do it as a team. 
Ocean health is like taken the vital signs of oceans. <<But what you need to know is that we combine lots of data and repeat and we do it as a team. >>

cut kraken

BUT. slide. MEME or illustration. have a conversation: Unliek many of you in the audience, as a budding marine scientist, I as not comfortable with coding. This was not smething that was part of my training as a scientist and because of that the path forward was not clear. 
but when it came to the data, I was unprepared. 

r4ds-eco: THIS IS BETTER SCIENCE IN LESS TIME

A team doesn't need to workgin on the same deliverables, but if you have the same practices you'll be better off
an example: malin dropbox github

They are Champions

the mindest is that you're expecting a better way. i'm not just giving defs, showing the mindset/interpretation: meaning behing meaning

tighten matlab dates more quickly

No petri dish, a thing you're examining and experimenting upon

Teamwork slide 40: write ethis out

why I want to tell you about seaside chates and hackathons

BH slide: Leadership is both vertical and horizontal. here's how it's veretical: ben was an encouraging. and that let us be horizontal. 

So what for each slide.

getting from community: learning new things, brining them back to be bettere team
giving back to the community: paying it forward and an example of what this can look like in science. 


End not with welcom doodle but with Hands

Harness the power of welcome: say hi to people and use the pacman rule. (people won't be have a COC). don't need subpoints. 

A really easy way we can all harness the power of welcome is to practice it here.

TODO THERE'S THIS CONCEPTION THAT THIS IS NOT HAPPENING BECAUSE SCIENTISTS AREN'T AWARE OF TOOLS, LIKEE THAT TELLING THEM TO USE GITHUB WILL COMPLETE THIS PICTURE HERE. 

From my experience, that is not the whole issue. It is rather that they aren't aware of how tools could be beneficial to them because they have never seen them in a familiar context
Further, they do not see welcoming entry ways to engage. I"m going to focus less on the tools and more on the teamwork.

# DOODLE

the communities we're in here have grown out of the interest in the tools. but that's not the entryway for everyone. I've been focused on the reverse process, trying to create solid teams that are stronger because of ods.

# OPEN SCIENCE


We invested a lot of time into creating a bigger community at UCSB. EDS, RLadies. Worth it. The more people who have these skills, the better for EDS. but more directly selfish, the more people who can help us when we have issues or teach us new things. The more people who we might potentially hire who already have these skills. In one glorious example, our OHI Fellows that we hire now come in w more training bc of Allision Horst 

Don't see the benefit to them, just the burden. 
I focus a lot on how this will save time: efficiency. but also happier
Now, seeing the benefit more, but no TIME or INCENTIVE

Sometimes I feel like I have tasked myself with such a hard job bc I have to peddle


progression list
barriers

i don't know it exists
i do'nt know how it's relevant for me (no examples)
i don't see the benefit, just the cost
it seems hard and scary 
i don't have time

openscapes is trying to work across this

open science
open science is not widely embraced in env. people think that it is posting data at the end, which is an additional ask. and it's also about stealing data. OHI actually got into OS bc it was free and efficient, not bc we were interested in this higher calling

let me walk through what I tell them
data science is a discipline
open science is a way to work


i like to talk about how it's a spectrum, and how there are benefits
