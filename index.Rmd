KEEP IN MIND

Environmental scientist doing research. "How can we bring this to science" is way too big

each slide is 2-3 sentences. percision of speech. every word should be throughful and precise. to create emphasis of tihngs

no: "i've been thinking a lot about" yes: "the question I ask: how can we ..."

add one sentence: environmental problems are critical. what a bummer what they don't 

this is my work, I'm neck-deep if I am asking the question if this is ncessarry? The answer is no every time.

Need to anchor beginning

The community that R is a part of. We are from finance and science and developers!!! Community of Jedis Put faces

Ignore this: not many jedis, elite. Not eeveryone? But in the world of R everyone can be a jedi? Have a resonse

I mentioned data layers but didn't say data needs
Show our maps: maps are important for showing spatial things for communication
Cornwall website things: tell a story about Cornwell. Why are they doing this? In Cornwall they are having issues with overfishing

The fact that I'm goinving a talk aobout an R conf and never talked abou tthis at an ocean conf speaks to the imporatnce. 

I instead of we

My whole thing is a bout team. A big part of this is about my personal transoforamation but it's really about the team. So my  story is the team story. 

Ending::: need a super summary to bring back to my main message: teams and openness. End with the profound single statement. 
Now that you've heard all of this you can see how teams are so important. But need to end with core message

You can do open science without being part of a team so this is something I am trying to work at. Core message. Visual

It's not about fixing problems it's about making something good even bnetter

Nature 2012 had a huge impact. But now accelerated impact. But the fact that we do it better now doesn't mean it wasn't good science the first time, it's just better and faster now. 

Data challenges have gotten bigger. And tools are here to ameiliarte. In the past the tools weren't even necessary. Didn't have asatellites. NOw we are seeing . Everything is happening faster. Need tools to meet these challenges. Until fairly recently haven't been available for the normal humans to use. Everything has changed, we need to get with the program. 

it's not that the science we do now is bad, it's better because it's faster, more open, streamlined, inclusive. 

Reorg Allison notes Jun 27
Nail down pacing and no ums

A goodie for their brain. Places where you can remind people of what they've already lerned is awesome. And a great way to transition.

this will shorten OHI part and set up Openscapes
And then I say is this is a feedback loop intertwined and working together. Positive feedback loop. So it took us 4 years to realize this. How do we make it so that it isn't so terrible and long process for other labs. 

transitiongremind why you talked about OHI
so we spent 4 years learning how to work as a team using ODS tools. In Openscapes I wanted to decrease that effort. That's waht drives Openscapes. get you from that big circle to the smaller circle in less time. 

Openscapes recipe connect this to the lessons learned from OHI> 
aspects of leadership and community
Cut the cohort summary. 
Cut the wods in the openscapes labs. 
*****They want to know the lessons learned. **** more imp than details. 
My personal story then OHI's story then Openscapes story and here's what I've learned throught his process so that
weekly meetings with calls, the point is doing this. 
CUT WORDS. a few high-impact sentences on each lessons learned.

Call to action part
return to loop
Yes we can learn the data science tool and when it comes to team building
Mindset shift to get into it. 
Empathy
Keep in minds soemthing i think is surprising: people we look at who are doing really amazing env science might be really intimidated by data science and they might need to be welcomed. 
Just bc someone is a brillant env scientce, they might still need help welcoming bc they are doing some of the toughest stuff in the world right now. 
< big pic recap: people answering raelly imporant qs in en sci don't always have the tool and teams they neeed but there are ways to welcome and empoer them to do bettere science in less time. 

comfortable not broadening past env sicent
env science should be a thing that intersts everyone
Qs: do you think this is true in othere fieelds? 
A: yes absolutely

Make big high-impact statement. OHI is a big deal. don't worry about overstating. make it a keynote. 



////
Q for Allison:

- Dolphin pic — too much? have multiple (ok this is what it's like)
- Nature figure 1, use original? Or simplified?
- Twitter stuff: how to include the hadley wizard quote? clippy? rOpenSci?


June 30 Notes from Allison
Good until Openscapes. 
If I put a picture of me and a squid you will need a sentence of what I'm doing. THis is me with a swud
Great transitions for intro!
ON the R4DS drawing: added credit updated from Wickham & Gr
super cleaned polished streamlined cutting words. But don't lose my enthusiam bc it's succinct
If I feel like I'm monotoned don't worry, i'll be more excited
OHI: worried about absolute stateents. OHI is '''one of the most visible'''. be careful not to make anyone defensive. 
need transiton bt describing OHI and and then to the paper intro. Maybe just wording, "so we wrote a paper about it" sounds aweful. We realized we wereon't the only team strugglin with data. so much that we published our story so other groups can learn from that. 
BSILT table and figures. When I show table: i'm not going through all of this and you don't need to read it. But our main shifts are these. 
Open source science >> good, keep. A strong
ANother ool thing we were trying to improve our own data science efforts but by createing packages and documentation and workflows but these empowered other researchers to do their own assessments on their own coastlines. 
Openscapes nail down transitions
Talk about seaside chats. These are separte meetings specifically about data. In our other lab meetings. We had to create a space to focus on the data. 
Make sure this still sounds like a story. Intro and OHI sounds like a story. Openscapes doesn't sound like a story. "we do this, also this", not intesting. 
Focus on what is the story of openscapes and whay is it so valuable and what comes out of it that proves that it's working. What is the big picture keynote worthy
Openscapes: other resarchar labs shouldn't have to figure this out on their own. they should customize a basic wheel so they have to create it from scratch. They shouldn't have to figure it out all on their own like we did with OHI

SEtup from OHI: Openscapes will be less painful and long for other groups. SEt this up by saying: if i had to generalize, the 2 main things we had to overcome in order to make this progr: we were unawarre of and benefit from open tools, and we weren't prioritizing teamowkr and culture in labs. These are the 2 problems that ware really common across env science reaseerch labs. 
What we realized is that both of these end points arentbeing addressed in reaserch labs and how they are connecteed wasn't discussed. So the dev and interconnectedness of both of these. And how it realtes to openscapes. OPENSCAPES IS MAKING THIS WHEEL

that's the big picutre problem. 
Also liked the concrete lessons learned so if I could say these. From case studies: it's a big up front time investment but worth it. 

story idea: Build / structure: keep returning to this loop. The first side we want to focus on is culture and support. until we deal with this ds will be deflating. So for the frist 5 weeks we focused on the culture side of things. Now we transition from open and trusta nd honesty. Then, what are the tools we can use within that to do bsilt. These tools and these communities. We realized this awesome loop exists that adccelerates our science and our quality of life. If that's what Openscapes is based on, keep returning to it. How do these interact with each other. Explain the loop that this creates for labs. How openscapse closes this into a cohesive loop
THose things can't exist separately if you want to succesfful lab, it makes everyone more happy labs operate as teams, makes it more reproducble happier


Q for A Hill: 
- hyperlink images from knitr::include_graphics()?

Jul 1
careful with overlapping language
for the presentationI need to decide on teamwork, don't say the collab leadership without being careful
"we started acting like a team" what does that actually mean and how does it differ from the way we were working before. 
is it github using same stuff
is it emotional like you support and care about each other
to be useful for the audience 
people need to walk away with and think about in their own life. In your ideal world you can't control who is your team but what can you do after you walk away. Thinking about the loop. 
Tables are in the ODS loop. leadership and community that 
WHAT IS WORKING LIKE A TEAM. The PI needs to leave thinking about this. And how to keep the bins organized. GitHub and Issues are parts of ODS. But leadership and community are teamwork. It's those intangibles. interpersonal relationship
The importance of willingness in teamwork: people have to be willing to be on the team and work like a team. And put time into it. 


Openscapse section wordy CUT
If parallel OHI, you should say it. Don't make audiences work hard to make parallels. Spell it out. So like we experienced with OHI, based on our experience, we did xyz. reminders, repetition, drawing parallels are great, just spell them out. 

If I hate it just cut it

Teamwork side of loop. As an intermediate after I describe after openscapes and then on the teamwork side have bullets of the goals or outcomes are of that. 

Start nailing down: need an awesome opening statement and really awesome ending statement. Big picture: what is this problem helping to 
in a time when env sci is our most pressing probs are related to env it's critical that those scientits have the tools and team to answer those quiestions using data. Memorize this and tempo. And what I'm offering as part of the solution. 

One of final slides
"this is powerful for science" >>> it's part of this for science. but it's also powerful for people. mental health, leaky pipeline, burnout. and maybe include this too. This is really powerful for science and individuals and teams. 

Good job leading it back to Luke with his mind broadened with ODS! << add this in the notes. 

What does make a team a team mean. Some people have played sports their whole lives and know aht it means. it has a feeling for them. But there are people who don't have that experience >> need tangible understanding of what that is. Offer counterpoints: here are examples as not working as part of a team. 
upskill, not having just 
there are a lot of aspects of working as a team. I'm going to focus on a few and to illustrate some progress I've made with as a team. 
Ways we weren't working as part of a team: we didn't even realized this wasn't teamly. :: 
and now we

you lose agency and control over the work. A person who knew how to work with data and invested the time. 
training, seaside chats, eco-data-science. and lifted ourselves up. 
On either end: I get slapped with everyone else's data

I need a response to teamwork that is separate from data science skills
Teamwork can be the act of skillsharing, empowering coworkers to do their own analyses
env scientists are used to working as teams in most aspects of their work. In the field, in the lab, when they're writing papers. but one way they don't think of working like teams is when it comes to data. 
Env scientists are good at teamwork because we have to be. we are answering big questions that require a lot of people to answer. but for some reason that teamwork that is so often in lab and field is not extended into data science. 

Jenny: With each section: what am I giving to my audience and is it clear to them

Qs from Allison: for audience
- what does acting like a team
- what is Opeancscapes doing to address eqity and diversity in env science
- what if there are leaders in labs that are resistant to sharing/collab/ods

From right now, cut all ums and ahs as I practice.

NO UM START >> WELL

Well thank you so much, I am so excited with all of you and I want to thank the organizers for this invitation. 

I am going to talk today about how R enables better science in less time, and how we can welcome more people to participate in our community.

I am a marine scientist, and I work with other marine scientists and more broadly with environmental scientists. 

transition: So I wanted to start by giving a sense of what we do and don't do, just to start us all of on the same page.

Studies like these are done by environmental scientists, who are folks in academia, in the public and non-profit sectors working on aspects of the environment and sustainabilty. 

We actually have a lot in common with the open source community because we are working for the public good, and passionate about our work. 

And although those headlines might make it seem that science is a uniformed effort,

science really operates in pockets, with individuals working primarily within research groups, which we also call laboratories in the United States.

transition: research laborties are often around a theme or topic, like a species, place, or method. My PhD lab was like this.

# BOMMER LINE

Intro: just start with the lab story, get to the point faster. I’m a marine scientist and this is what my lab was doing what was so interesting was that I defined my problem and now my career is solving it. 

I'm a marine scientist and like many scientists I focused on a challenge in graduate school and am planning to spend my career trying to solve it. But this challenge is not about the interactions of camouflage and jet propulsion that you might expect from a squid ecologist. The challenge I'm dedicated to is helping scientists create community and learn to code in order to do better science in less time. 

I've been doing this for 6 years now and  there are 3 things that I've learned and I'm going to start with them up front. 

I'll build them out as we go, sharing about life in a marine science research group laboratory, and how this has taken me around the world for ocean health and how I've been working with Mozilla creating a program for marine and environmental scientists, which include those people who study things on land. 

And to keep it break it up I'll pepper the talk with artwork and photography by environmental science RLadies.

# Lessons learned

# Squid lab pic

???
We were a squid lab, broadly interested to understand how squid interact with ecosystems and drive economies through fisheries, and how climate change is affecting all this. 

transition: Although we had the same anchor, all of us in the lab focused on different pieces of this broader interest. 

---
# pic john field maps

???

I focused on adult behavior and migration, and how this is relevant to fisheries, conservation, and impacted by climate change

---
# pic chromatophores

???

others studied physiology, neuroscience, vision, and camouflage, which is really important since we have learned a lot about human neurons through studying squid neurons

---
# pic baby squid

???

also about development of squid babies, that are only 1 mm long when they hatch but can grow to be nearly my size in less than a year, meaning they eat a lot. 

---
# pic fieldwork

???

This meant we did a lot of work at sea and in the lab. We would go fishing and catch and release squid that we tagged with electronic tags so they would turn into little oceanographers as they swam. 

And we helped each other with our scientific work, we did field work with each other, helped keep squid alive in aquaria.

---
# Add slide? we worked together

---
# funny pic?

???

But it's not so smooth going. Because in all my education I had learned about physiology and ecology and oceanography. But I had never learned how to work responsibly with my data. 

And even though our research group would collaborate with each other with designing hypotheses and collecting data, we were eeach on our own to actually analyze our data. This means we start with the skills we have, which is usually Excel. If we learn how to code, it is often in a panic, and we learn and do just enough to get the job done.

<!---
So even though we are coding it is often does not result in reproducible science because first off, the author of the code isn't proud of it and doesn't want to share, and even if she does it often is riddled with hard-coded local filepaths that only work on the author's computer.
--->

This whole data analysis experience can be super lonely and isolating. And we don't even know what is possible, so we don't have the vocabulary or even the concepts to articulate our struggles and ask for help. 

<!---
But more than that, it can be really intimidating to talk about because you don't see any examples of other people talking about it. So you feel like an imposter, and that somehow everyone else learned to code as part of their marine science education but you missed it.

And Yoda uses the Force to solve Luke's problem in a way he never imagined.

Open data science is the Force that enables us to do better science in less time. 

And the rebel alliance is our community, everyone in this room. 

Having this community has been absolutely game-changing for me as a scientist. 

Instead of feeling stranded and deflated in a data swamp, I have a much broader and more optimistic mindset of what is possible with data, and that revolutionizes what I think is possible with science and how science can help tackle our biggest environmental challenges. 

And it is really critical that all environmental scientists feel this powerful and this supported, because for the most part they are not. 

transition: But let's talk about what it can look like, and we can use a non-squid example

So let's think about agriculture. There might be an ecologist who is studying the role that bees play in pollinating crops, and how drought impacts this interaction. 

To do this she might collect data on the biology, behavior, and genomics of different bee populations, and combine that with data on water availability from snowmelt and groundwater. 

So she would have a lot of different data types to make sense of, from visual observations, genetic sequences, and from sensors on the ground and from satellites. 

transition: Her findings are impactful and important to communicate to different audiences.

Her results help inform policy and management decisions around food systems, disease transmission, sustainability, and climate change. 

She is likely working with governments at local and international scales to help inform change on the ground.

This picture here is the way science works right now. We are really good at theory, developing hypotheses, and experimental design. And we are getting better and better at communication and helping our findings get to the right audiences.

But there is this huge missing part here in the middle.

We were able to get by in the past but data challenges have gotten bigger and faster and we are not prepared. 

transition: But as we know from Star Wars, open data science and teamwork can really complete this picture here.

I know this graphic looks familiar, but notice that all of the open data science components here are ringed by communities and support. R really streamlines how we work with data, and also streamlines how we work with each other. 

And streamlining this process from data to communication is critical for environmental science so that we can uncover solutions for our greatest challenges. 

Making this a reality in environmental science requires changes in mindset for individual researchers and cultural change in research groups, which is a big task. 

But I am optimistic because I have lived through this mindset change myself, and ever since I have focused on igniting this cultural change more broadly. 

transition: So I want to talk about a few examples and strategies for making this a reality.  

TODO THERE'S THIS CONCEPTION THAT THIS IS NOT HAPPENING BECAUSE SCIENTISTS AREN'T AWARE OF TOOLS, LIKEE THAT TELLING THEM TO USE GITHUB WILL COMPLETE THIS PICTURE HERE. 

From my experience, that is not the whole issue. It is rather that they aren't aware of how tools could be beneficial to them because they have never seen them in a familiar context
Further, they do not see welcoming entry ways to engage. I"m going to focus less on the tools and more on the teamwork. 

---
# DOODLE

the communities we're in here have grown out of the interest in the tools. but that's not the entryway for everyone. I've been focused on the reverse process, trying to create solid teams that are stronger because of ods.

This past year as a Fellow with Mozilla, I've created a mentorship program called Openscapes.

Openscapes is a mentorship program, welcoming research groups to engage with open data science and become visible examples and vocal ambassadors for its awesomeness within their broader communities. 

We've just completed the pilot cohort with 7 research groups, and I'm excited to tell you all about it bc we all learned a lot and I am so proud of what they accomplished.

But to tell the Openscapes story I need to first tell the Ocean Health Index story.

And that's because I designed Openscapes based on my experiences with The Ocean Health Index. 

Today, OHI is one of the most visible examples of how powerful open data science and teamwork can be for environmental science. 

transition: But it didn't start out that way.

TODO:: After I completed my PhD, I joined the Ocean Health Index, and have been with this research group I've worked with for the past six years.  I graduated and was no longer a drad student and with a team but still found myself struggling


This is a big project where we are trying on a to better understand and quantify the health of our oceans on a global scale, 

in a way that is useful and actionable for policy. 

The OHI focuses on the benefits that the ocean provides people

<!---From all of this, --->

And from all that modeling we create maps like these, with scores reflecting how healthy oceans are for every coastal country around the world. 

And ever since, we have repeated this work every year so that we could understand how ocean health changes through time, and these ocean health index scores are now being used by the United Nations to help understand environmental trends.

<Jamie do we have a GIF of this?>

So the OHI and these global assessments are a really massive novel scientific and communication undertaking. And it also meant to do sound and reproducible data science.

But we did not know how. 

transition: when we first developed the OHI in 2012, we had files like these.

We were marine scientists using the tools and approaches we had learned along the way.

We published our story about our path to better science in less time using open data science tools. 

It is a retrospective of how we incrementally improved our workflow over four years, using R, RStudio & and GitHub

This is a figure from the paper showing how it took us less time each year to redo our work, and that it got easier to be reproducible and collaborate with others. In 2012 it took 4 years, and 20 team members. Now in 2019 it takes eight months, and 2 or 3 graduate student interns that we mentor parttime.

TODO: take more time to walk through. 

And this shows time, and time saved is money saved. 

In 2012 it took us 3M, and now in 2019 it takes 250K.

We are certainly not the first to publish about why open science and data science is important, but I think why it has really resonated with people is that we shared how hard this transition was for us. 

transition: Because we really face a reckoning with the way we worked with data. We had to admit to ourselves that the way we were working wasn't working. And we had to completely change how we worked, and it was really intimidating moving into such unknown territory.

# Open data science

# Reproducibility
# Collaboration
# Communication
???

We share how we upgraded the way we work in terms of repro, collab, comm. 

It took us a long time to categorize our work like this because it required abstracting data science steps from our ocean health index steps. 

We had never thought about what were data challenges universally held by everyone and what were science challenges we faced with ocean health. So teasing these apart and articulating them was a big part of this story. 


TODO:: I'm not going to get into all the details but those issues I mentioned above were solved like this: 

repro: .xls --> .R
collab: fwd --> GitHub issues (simplified)
comm: static pdf --> RMarkdown-based websites

```

.footnote[

We thought about our path to reprocibility as data prep, modeling, version control, and organization, thought about what we did before, now, and the tools we used. 


IT TOOK US SO LONG TO SEPARATE OUT DATA WRANGLING FROM MODELING

```

]

???

You don't have to read through all of this, but the summary is that 

We had really been doing things by hand and with our own homegrown systems, so the biggest changes were using R and GitHub for everything, and having shared practices and conventions with the tidyverse and file storage. 

---
# Collaboration

```{r collab, eval=require('DT'), echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
table1 %>%
  dplyr::filter(Task %in% c("coding", "workflow and project management", "internal collaboration")) %>%
   dplyr::mutate(
    Then = "",
    Now = "",
    `Primary open data science tools` = "") %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")

```

.footnote[
[Lowndes *et al.* 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160)
]

???
We thought the same way about collaboration, thinking about our coding, workflows, and internal correspondance.

---
# Collaboration

```{r collab-complete, eval=require('DT'), echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
table1 %>%
  dplyr::filter(Task %in% c("coding", "workflow and project management", "internal collaboration")) %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")
```

.footnote[
[Lowndes *et al.* 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160)
]

???
Not only did shared convensions with R help our coding, but shared convensions with GitHub helped our project management and our documentation. 

Using GitHub for all of this was really helpful for onboarding new teammembers.

---
# Communication

```{r comm, eval=require('DT'), echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
table1 %>%
  dplyr::filter(Task %in% c("sharing data", "sharing methods")) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    Then = "",
    Now = "",
    `Primary open data science tools` = "") %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")

```

.footnote[
[Lowndes *et al.* 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160)
]

???
And finally for communication, we thought about this in terms of how we shared our data and methods. 

For scientists using traditional tools, communication is really limited to the end of a project when everything can be wrapped into a PDF and data put on a remote server somewhere.

---
# Communication

```{r comm-complete, eval=require('DT'), echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
table1 %>%
  dplyr::filter(Task %in% c("sharing data", "sharing methods")) %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")

```

.footnote[
[Lowndes *et al.* 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160)
]

???

But using R and GitHub completely changed how we think about communication and what's possible for science. 

We can do everything online. Not just all our code and data are online throughout the process, 

but RMarkdown made us become web developers and can and share things along the way, not only at the end. 

And it also enabled us to create a whole international online training program and provide tech support. 

This is a huge deal for environmental science, since there are so many different audiences involve and being able to communicate as data decisions are being made rather than only at the end is huge.

transition: so what this all looks like is

# Open source science

???
 
And what this all means is that we do open source science. 

It is easier for anyone to build off of our science because they can build directly off our code. 

And this is true even before it's published, while it is ongoing. 

And GitHub lets us share and distribute our code which has no comparison if you're used to forwarding pdfs to collaborators.

transition: working this way has made our initial intention and dream to become a reality, which is to have independent groups be able to lead their own OHI assessments. 

---
# OHI+ map 

???

And we have had over 20 groups using our science and our code to do OHI assessments in the places they care about. 

There is obviously much more that goes into ocean managemtent than just code, but data and code have been huge roadblocks in the past, and difficulties in sharing and distributing has led to many efforts constantly reinventing the wheel. 

We created a training program to help them understand the science and the code, and create template GitHub repos for them to organize their data and use the ohicore package.

TODO WHAT DID WE OVERCOME TEAMWISE? TELL STORIES

I'll talk about these in terms of working openly, leadership, and community.


<!---
Steph::

before you can become a team you have to feel safe. safe to fail. 
There's the people part
and there's the env part
. you can share when things aren't perfect and trust that people won't make you feel like an iditio. inclusive
people part: you hve to ave people that are willing to do that. willing to be vulnearable. It takes strength to be vlunerable. 
And you have to have people that are not afraid of change, are willing to change. willing to learn. openminded to try new ideas. aren't afraid of failing. and if you fail, share what went wrong. 
failure is such a part of openness. And a part of tearing down imposter
communication is key: talking face to face, documenting pracitces. 

one more piece: not just in yourself being vulnerable
And encouraging others is important. encouraging others to be vulnerable. Not just creating your own safe space and creating a safe space for others. 
Creating a space where others can be vulnerable too. 

leadership: vertical but also horizontal leadership and leadership from within.

# Working openly
a picture?


???

We work really openly with each other. We co-develop things, we share early drafts, and we are constantly giving feedback and iterating with each other. 

And that is because we feel safe with each other. 

We have established a safe space where we trust each other. 

We assume best intentions with everything we do. So critique and improvement come from the intent of making it better. 

and we are not afraid to fail, we actually share our failures and learn from them.


---
# Working openly
write these out in columns

???

Thnk about this in terms of individuals and tone they set as a team


So for individuals, this requires being comfortable with vulnerability and being willing to share things that aren't perfect. 

It also means not being afraid of change, and being willing to change and learn. 

Being open helps immensely with tearing down imposter syndrome. Internalizing that no one can do it all is increcibly liberating and one of the most productive things you can do. Everyone thinks they are imposters in different context. But you aren't; you just have different skillsets. But being honest about this helps

Setting the tone

And then for the team, it means being inclusive and welcoming 

creating not just a safe space for yourself but a space where others can be vulnerable. This is a place you can share imperfect things because sharing it It will prabbly get better. Put it out there before it's done. It's better together. No one has all the answers. 

We also greatly respect each others' time. We start and end meetings on time. try to be realistic with deadlines

transition: in terms of creating a team around open data science, seaside chats were instrumental.

---
# pic seaside chat TODO break into 2 slides

???

So the way we established this was by having regular meetings with our team to talk about data. We call these seaside chats 

<!---
Fireside chats:which served to share with the whole country into his thought process, daylighting all of his decisions and opening them up for examination. It helped bring folks on board with his decisions, helped them understand the policies that would come to affect their lives, and gave citizens the ability to provide feedback on the war they were paying for with money and lives.
--->

They are not actually by the sea, but they are informal chats that we have weekly to discuss shared workflows and teach each other what we know and what we're doing. 

In seaside chats we'll watch RStudio webinars, we'll discuss our Google Drive folder structure, we'll discuss filenaming conventions. 

We also have hackthons, where we will all drop our own projects and come together for a day or an afternoon to do something that will benefit the whole group. So this is where we will actually overhaul our filepath conventions with the here package or modernize all our code with dplyr instead of plyr. 

In seaside chats and hackathons we've also developed written protocols for onboarding new teammembers so that they can get upskilled and in our workflow as soon as possible.

---
# pic happy hour

???

And we also often have lunch and happy hours, which is evident because all of our team pictures are selfies at HH. So a shared practice of beer gardens might be part of team building for us. 

transition: So this is all critical to operating like a team and being effective with how we work. And it was ignited by really supportive leadership.

# Leadership — vertical

pic Ben Halpern


???

This is Ben Halpern, he's the lead of OHI and also the director of NCEAS, the ecology center where we are based. 

He set this tone for our team, and also critically, modeled a healthy work-life balance and boundaries 
He has played a huge role in our data science story because he supported us to pursue it. 

And this is really critical. He is not a coder himself but saw that we were excited about it and gave us space and trusted us to learn data science and implement standard operating procedures for our team.

He actually doesn't participate in seaside chats because he does not need additional meetings in his life but he really encouraged us to do that on our own. 

But he is super engaged in what this enables us to do, and is a huge champion for open data science at NCEAS and Univ California where we work

So community starts with Twitter. 

I joined Twitter to learn R. 

And it's because my colleague Jamie encouraged me to. 

I had never used Twitter before, so I was definitely skeptical. I thought it was a megaphone for angry people. 

I didn't realize it was a place to have thoughtful conversations with lovely people, and most of all is is a way to listen and learn with others. 

So I was amazed that you could have community on Twitter 

and I was also amazed that developers were real people. And not only that, they were super nice people that made me feel welcome and valued even as I was feeling insecure about my coding skills. 

Prior to these communities I had never stopped to think that there were real people behind software. 

transition: Before R, this is the closest I'd ever come:

These communities really broadened my thinking of what collaboration and teamwork meant, and I really started feeling that open data science was more than code, it was a better way to work and a better way to do science. 

This was really the defining point in my life. This is was that turning point when I really became the person I am today — that person who never stops talking about the wonders of R and data science and open science and community.

# open data science <-> teamwork doodle

???

The more I reflect on this the more I realized is that data science and teamwork exist together in a feedback loop that streamlined how we work and innovate. 

Learning and using similar software promotes and streamlines teammwork. And also working as a team better equips you to learn open practices data science.

You really need both. Trying to engage solely with open data science without teamwork can be lonely and deflating. And only as a team but without the best collaborative software can be inefficient.

transition: This is a loop that feeds back on itself. For me, and likely for a lot of us in this room, this becomes difficult to differentiate and tease apart.

So it took our Ocean Health Index team 4 years to learn how to work as a team and use open data science tools. 

That's too long. That's too long for anyone but especially too long for our environment and climate change.

So how do we accelerate this and make it so that it isn't such a painful and long process for other labs?

transition: This is what drives Openscapes.

With Openscapes I am trying to help other research groups adopt these practices that we have found so successful. 

Openscapes is a mentorship program for research groups to help them do better science in less time. 

I introduce these aspects of open data science and teamwork, and I do so through a program structure that Mozilla has developed and found to be really successful. 

<!---
What we realized is that both of these end points arentbeing addressed in reaserch labs and how they are connecteed wasn't discussed. So the dev and interconnectedness of both of these. And how it realtes to openscapes. Openscapes will be less painful and long for other groups.
 OPENSCAPES IS MAKING THIS WHEEL

---
# Zoom
(break into a few slides)

???

It is an online mentorship program, with scientists from 7 research groups participating for 5 months.

Leaders and members from each research group participate, so we have a mix of faculty, lecturers, and program managers, along with graduate students, postdocs, techniciants, and lab managers. 

And 2x per month we get all participants from all labs together on the same call. 

This can be challenging, but it is deliberate. 

We want everyone to see and value what is possible and for them to engage and champion it in ways that align with their roles and responsibilities. 

So faculty can be most effective by supporting their teams, advocating for Carpentries workshops, and speaking up in faculty meetings about making it become official parts of the curriculum. 

Lab managers can become leaders within the lab, helping everyone become onboarded to the lab's github organization when they join the lab

And graduate students and postdocs who work with data every day can find common ground and vocabulary with data wrangling. 

And we do all research groups together because it's important to build alliances not only within labs but across them. Not only do we all learn more and it's more fun, but one of the main goals of Openscapes is to amplify our efforts nad each other so that these practices become more visible and more valued in environmental communities more broadly. 

<!---

SEtup from OHI: 

story idea: Build / structure: keep returning to this loop. The first side we want to focus on is culture and support. until we deal with this ds will be deflating. So for the frist 5 weeks we focused on the culture side of things. Now we transition from open and trusta nd honesty. Then, what are the tools we can use within that to do bsilt. These tools and these communities. We realized this awesome loop exists that adccelerates our science and our quality of life. If that's what Openscapes is based on, keep returning to it. How do these interact with each other. Explain the loop that this creates for labs. How openscapse closes this into a cohesive loop
THose things can't exist separately if you want to succesfful lab, it makes everyone more happy labs operate as teams, makes it more reproducble happier

# todo pic: ods-teamwork-loop

This is not about hands-on training or coding, but indstead about creating a culture of teamwork and an expectation that there are better ways to work, and pathways to improvement. 

The first half of the program we focus on teamwork and culture within the research group, and in the second half we transitioned to the open data science tools that enable better science in less time.


So for teamwork, we focus on creating supportive leadership in a data science and digital context, helping research groups become teams, and helping them discover and engage with online communities and participate in and start local communnities.

Steph notes Jul 2:

How imporatnt env science is to other things. Ag and health. And that's where you need to be open and inclusive and welcoming. Beause everyone thinks of themselves as imposters in different context. But they aren't they just have different skillsets. 
Maybe fits into the mindset: willing to be need to become  comfortable with putting yourself out there and your work out there before it's perfect. It will prabbly get better. Put it out there before it's done. It's better together. No one has all the answers. 

Assume best intentions. Critique and improvement come from the intent of making it better. Not because you're an imposter.

Walk the walk. This isn't the most perfect talk but i've made these decisions. People connect with me when I do that.

willing to put things out there even when they're not perfect.

<br>

???

So throughout all of this, I have three lessons learned. 

These come through my experiences as a PhD student studying squid, through six years with the Ocean Health Index team and this R community, and with my most recent year with Mozilla and Openscapes. 

They are guiding principles for me, and what I advise for environmental scientists. But they are relevant much more broadly so I hope they will be useful for everyone here as as well.

The first is that open data science is a mindset. 

Yes, it is also tools and practices for data analysis and reproducibility. 

But it is also an expectation that there is a better way to work, 

and it is confidence and willingness to figure it out and innovate. 

It's how the Force was not only a skillset but it broadened Luke's mind of what was possible and the scope of challenges he could tackle. 

<!---
How imporatnt env science is to other things. Ag and health. 
Maybe fits into the mindset: willing to be need to become  comfortable with putting yourself out there and your work out there before it's perfect. It will prabbly get better. Put it out there before it's done. It's better together. No one has all the answers.

Steph::

before you can become a team you have to feel safe. safe to fail. 
There's the people part
and there's the env part
. you can share when things aren't perfect and trust that people won't make you feel like an iditio. inclusive
people part: you hve to ave people that are willing to do that. willing to be vulnearable. It takes strength to be vlunerable. 
And you have to have people that are not afraid of change, are willing to change. willing to learn. openminded to try new ideas. aren't afraid of failing. and if you fail, share what went wrong. 
failure is such a part of openness. And a part of tearing down imposter
communication is key: talking face to face, documenting pracitces. 

one more piece: not just in yourself being vulnerable
And encouraging others is important. encouraging others to be vulnerable. Not just creating your own safe space and creating a safe space for others. 
Creating a space where others can be vulnerable too. 

How to get rid of cruft: write a POP for my presentation. Make sure that everything leads back to my POP

It takes strength to be vulnerable. 

<!---

Teamwork starts with future you and future us. 

This is about thinking ahead for what will make your analytical life better, but also the analytical life of your team. 

This means creating work environments where everyone feels comfortable and are supported to do their best work. Codes of Conduct can play a big role in this.  

This means having good leadership and room to grow as leaders 

This means creating trust and shared norms, and it takes time. But particularly 


Teamwork is really important for science and discovery. But it's also powerful for people. Mental health, leaky pipeline, burnout. and maybe include this too. This is really powerful for science and individuals and teams.

# Harness the power of welcome 


???

And lastly, leverage the power of welcome. 

This means being a friendly face and encouragement for others, and thinking about where they are coming from.

be open and inclusive and welcoming. Beause everyone thinks of themselves as imposters in different context. But they aren't they just have different skillsets. 

<!---
I have realized that researchers who are doing amazing env science might be really intimidated by data science and they might need to be welcomed.

I learned this early from the folks at rOpenSci and RStudio with their commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive space. 

And it has been a big part of my experience and education with Mozilla, and a foundational part of Openscapes.

# openscapes

so openscapes hasn't solved all of these issues yet 

→ could also frame positiviely: i haven’t solved all of open science, even in the first openscapes champions here are some struggles that I had trouble advising and I want to figure out to do better and help mentor better. If others are in this boat we could frame together. 
Could say: I’m really interested in talking with people of how to move this forward. Diff from “you need to support me”
If i’m talking about future challenges: how you find funding to support this kind of mentorship that is not part of how scientific resaerch tends to get funded. It’s a systemic weakness. It’s not me specifically unfunded. It’s systemcie
It is hard to find funding to support thes initiaitves

# wrap up 

What’s been challenging and what we’re still working on as a more collaborative community.

#squid closure
Now I’m doing this presentation at an R conference, in R. What I was able to overcome and what I could do. 
Need closure to “this was really hard and I didn’t know anything”.

These things fuel what it means to work responsibly and collaboratively 

and should also fuel what it means to be a scientist.

And the awesome thing is that we all have our part. 

a critical thing is that anyone can step up and be a leader. 

And the easiest/fastest way is to welcome and encourage others with open data science and teamwork.

And if you yourself are unsure you have a team or feel like you're on the outside of the feedback loop or on the threshold, know that since you're here so you're already part of it. 


ENDING: so we can all think about this in our own situations and also think of how we can support environmental scienists...

in a time when env sci is our most pressing probs are related to env it's critical that those scientits have the tools and team to answer those quiestions using data.

<!--- Memorize this and tempo. And what I'm offering as part of the solution. 

One of final slides
"this is powerful for science" >>> it's part of this for science. but it's also powerful for people. mental health, leaky pipeline, burnout. and maybe include this too. This is really powerful for science and individuals and teams.

challenges ops?

biggest challenges:
- labs dont think like teams
- pis feel they should leearn first

big ops
- talk to colleagues

comes back to making this more visiblee so can be more valued

how do you set up good practices for the lab when you do not know those practices yourself? And if you don't have time to learn, and they're always changing? 
- I feel it. Need help with databases. 


Obstacles
And there are obstacles, the primary being time, especially when this investmentis not evaluated or rewarded broadly in the academic structure in regards to promotion and job security. 

And there are opps but challenges as teams. how do you lead well when you dont know?

I want to end by saying thank you to this community for so many things, but particurly to its leadership in creating a diverse and inclusive space. I have learned so much about the importance of diverse and inclusive spaces, and this is an area that I in particular want to help extend these aspects of our culture to the environmental science community, and well beyond. 

Thank you.
