<!---KEEP IN MIND

Environmental scientist doing research. "How can we bring this to science" is way too big
When I say science = = "bring #rstats to science" what does that mean
"when I say bring to science the level I'm talking about is here" 


TOO MANY WORDS> the most important things get lost if each is a full paragraph

each slide is 2-3 sentences. percision of speech. every word should be throughful and precise. to create emphasis of tihngs


instead of saying "i've been thinking a lot about" "the question I ask: how can we bring this ethos to env sci". That's been guiding my efforts

add one sentence: environmental problems are critical. what a bummer what they don't 

storyline is good in the intro. Stop changing it. This is good. Get the words nailed down so that they're great and precise. 

Then, we can talk about whether we don't talk about env science enough. WEDS

in next few days say intro bare bones.

I am a marine ecologist, and #rstats has been life-changing for me.

I am a marine ecologist, and #rstats has been life-changing for me. 

It has been so impactful for me as a scientist that I have been moving away from doing my own research so I can enable other scientists to do better science in less time. 

Today I'll tell you a bit about me and how #rstats has revolutionized our work with the Ocean Health Index. And I'll end with Openscapes, which is a program I've developed over the past year as a Fellow with Mozilla. 

<< keep this super clean/polished as opening statement

pic montage of me at sea, mbari squid?

???

For my PhD, I studied a species of squid that can be as big as I am. 

It lives in the Pacific Ocean, traditionally from Chile to Mexico, and is one of the biggest fisheries in the world, which means that there are a lot of them, and we remove a lot of them from the ecosystem so that we can eat them and use them for agriculture and aquaculture. 

For about 15 years, they had extended their habitat range northward, into California where I was based, northern US, Canada, Alaska. 

My PhD research was to understand what they were doing and the impact they were having on our local ecosystems, and how climate change was involved.

To prepare for my field work, I learned about oceanography and how temperature, oxygen availablilty, nutrients, and currents work in the Pacific. 

I learned about squid, how they move, etc. I studied the ecology, the fisheries. 

transition: I got to collaborate with a lot of scientists and learn from them.

---
pic: tagging squid

???

My fieldwork involved going out to sea, catching squid, and releasing them back in the ocean with a data logger on them. They would become little oceanographers themselves, with the tags recording temp and depth as they swam. 

It was super cool. We collected data every second, which meant you'd be able to see them breath, since they move by jet propulsion and their breathing is coupled with swimming. 

---
pic: holding tag

???

So after all this work you can imagine how cool it was to get this data logger back and actually hold the data in my hand. 

But what happened then was that I quickly and sadly realized that even though i hold that data, I didn't have the tools or skillsets to to work responsibly with my data on my own. 

I felt so lonely and isolated. 

And the irony of that is that most environmental scientists feel that same way. 

We are studying some of the biggest challenges our planets face, and while we are experts on our study systems and theory, we are on our own for data analysis. 

We are rarely taught how to code or work responsibly with data. 

So we are all responsible for doing the best we can, and we spend a lot of time creating our own bespoke approaches to analyzing data. 

transition: To drive home what this feels like, I like to talk about this with star wars analogies.

Luke

???

<<Careful saying "scientists" generally w/o qualifier

This is the feeling we can see Luke having when he crashed his plane in the swamp. 

He is demoralized and alone, staring at a challenge that he cannot solve with the skillsets he has. 

He has no idea how to even begin this process. 

transition: but what happens next is that he meets Yoda 

<!---
**this is the feeling when you don't have the toolset. but you can learn when you have a community ** Don't overexplain the metaphore.
--->

Yoda


???

And Yoda has a skillset to solve this challenge in a better and more efficient way: he uses the Force. 
<!---didn't even know existed--->

The Force can solve Luke's problem in a way he never imagined. 

And Luke can learn from Yoda, and he will develop skills to not only solve this problem, but it will open his mind to what is possible and the challenges he can take on. 

<!---Luke's ability and successes don't come individually, this comes from supportive environments.--->

transition: But it is not just the tools that make Luke successful, it is the community that he is a part of. 

<!---But also a super important part is that it's not just about the tools (Force) and the people that know them (Jedis).--->

---
Hands

???

Luke's community is not made up of only Jedis with the same skillsets he has. This is a movement made up of diverse people (and droids, wookies, and whatever yoda is) from different backgrounds, and all of them contribute in really important ways. 

transition: So the Force is #rstats, or more broadly, it's open data science. And the community is us, the people in this room. 

---
# /#rstats
Hands w/ logos: RStudio, rOpenSci, RLadies, Carpentries, Mozilla


???

Our #rstats community is so amazing. 

It is welcoming, it is inclusive, it is supportive, it is empowering. 
<!---we stand up for each other--->

There is such a mix of people from diverse backgrounds and experiences, from all over the world, online and in person, innovating and learning together. 

What's different about our #rstats community is that we put people first. We've put a big emphasis on communication and culture

This has been so impactful for me as a scientist. Instead of feeling stranded in a swamp like I did when I was a PhD student, I am more powerful than I ever imagined. 

The people here in this room have helped me change the way I do science and the way I think about what is possible. They have empowered me and helped me build confidence that translates well beyond code. 

We are all here because we have been empowered by R as a tool and a community, but we can all probably think of others that are still feeling stranded and alone. We might work with them day-to-day. 

transition: So my question is — 

---
# How do we extend the #rstats culture?

???

How do we extend the #rstats culture and welcome more people?

There are so many communities that could be enriched not only by #rstats tools, but but #rstat culture. What the #rstats culture became the ethos for their communities as well? 

<!---
I think we can welcome them not only with the tools but with the culture. 

But we have to really understand 
Knowing that folks have a lot of responsibilities already and can feel isolated, and overwhelmed about coding, how do you welcome more people?

transition: I think about the way things work in environmental science —

R4DS fig minus hadley

We are really passionate experts in our domain science, and we are effective communicators, helping solve environmental challenges based on our science. 

But we still act a lot like individuals because we don't have a common culture or toolset. We are working on really complex, emotionally draining challenges, but we don't have a culture like we do with #rstats  

???

transition: But we could: 

---
R4DS complete

here's what I want to do about it. 

???

But this is what it could look like. 

If environmental scientists who already doing such important work, could be using the Force adn #rstats, and feeling great about it with the community and culture, it is really hopeful what we will be able to do. 

Right now one of the biggest obstacles to getting here is that it that coding and data analysis is not valued in the environmental science. I said before that we don't have a culture of teaching it but we do not have a culture of talking about it.  

So increase its value within environmental science, we need to increase its visibility. We need this to be something that people talk about and get excited about. We need more people like me, who get a reputation for never shutting up about it. 

And because we know how important community is, we can start with existing communities in science - the laboratory. 

If we can help labs operate like our #rstats community, they will also become champions within their broader communities and this will have a ripple effect throughout environmental science. 

For the rest of the talk I'll share what this can look like in environmental science labs, and how we can replicate this with other teams. 

And I also want to emphasize that although I am focusing on environmental science, these examples have relevance well beyond. We can all be leaders in our communities to welcome more people and teams to the welcoming power of #rstats.

# How the Ocean Health Index became an example of ODS

OHI measure illustration

???
The ocean health index is a project to measure how healthy oceans are using the best available data and science. 

It is a really ambitious project. It set out to be the best approach that governments and policy makers around the world could use and build from, and indeed now it is used by the United Nations and twenty government and university groups around the world are using it as well. 

<!---And there is no way that we could have so much reach and impact without #rstats and the ODS community.---> 

transition: we didn't set out to be the best approach for what open data science could look like in environmental science —

---
nature paper

???

But when we stepped back and realized it was an important story to tell, it resonated with a lot of people. 

Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools is a retrospective of how we incrementally introduced #rstats and GitHub into our workflow over a period of four years. 

I won't go through all of this here but I want to give some highlights, particularly focusing on communication and collaboration. 

---
image of a house blueprint.

The Ocean Health Index is essentially a blueprint for measuring ocean health. 

A blueprint for a house would include walls, floors, and a roof, but houses around the world look different because of the materials available and local conditions. For example, houses look different in places with different amounts of snow, rain, or sun. 

The Ocean Health Index blueprint includes things that provides benefits to people, and that people can manage. So it includes the seafood we eat, jobs, tourism, the habitats that mitigate storm damage, and includes pressures affecting these benefits like climate change, as well as management policies that can counteract those pressures.

transition: 

---

???

It took almost 4 years to develop this blueprint and use it to calculate ocean health scores for global oceans, which means all countries and territories with a coastline. 

This included almost 100 publicly data sets from the United Nations, World Bank, as well as global studies and satellite data. 

The plan from the beginning was to repeat this global study each year, because the value of the OHI is not in doing it once, but in tracking change through time and acting upon the most pressing needs. 

transition: but did these analyses using the tools we knew, like Luke Skywalker would have back on Dagobah.

data_analysis_v2.xls
re:fwd:final data updated

???

Data processing was done in excel and a bit in R, with decisions documented in accompanying Word documents and emails. 

The programmer on the team would write models in whatever language best suited the data. 

So the next year when we went to repeat the analysis, there was a lot of forensics and detective work to uncover what we had done the first time, and why. 

That's the year I started. 

Needless to say, we needed a better system. So here is what we do now. And again, this was over a four-year period, and we continue to iterate and improve. 

---
(maybe bullet this, and animate?)

- create a GitHub organization, everyone makes an account
- data prep and models in R
- use RStudio & GitHub (version control & communication)
- coding norms: `tidyverse` & friends
- separate core "blueprint" models into R package `ohicore`
- separate "tailorable" models into separate repos 
- data prep narratives in R Markdown

???

---
ohi-science.org

???

we also created a website with R and friends for our Ocean Health Index community so that we could get beyond forwarding PDFs and writing individual emails. 

The home page is with Jekyll

transition: we also generate simple RMarkdown websites for each as well: ohi-global

github for communication

- private repo for all issues
  - methods discussion in one place
  - good for onboarding new team members
  - our boss gets these as emails and can review & contribute from email
- everyone on our team has admin priveleges e
  - very few branches & pull requests
- push & pull for IT/troubleshooting

???

We use GitHub in a few perhaps unconventional ways. 

---
toolbox-training

to teach people how to use our software, we've been working on a book

---
data-science-training

???

and we also realized we needed to teach groups how to work with #rstats and Github like we do.

---
ohi-northeast dashboard

???
We are also using shiny in a few ways, but I think this is one of the coolest. 

We are leading OHI Northeast, and it is actually included in part of President Obama's ocean plan. 

The code is based from XXX's, who we saw present at RStudio::conf 2018. 

---

OHI team qualities (circa 2014)

- someone really jazzed about #rstats (Ben Best)
- a boss/project lead who valued it & gave us space to learn (Ben Halpern)
- welcoming people from the #rstats community (Karthik Ram, Hadley Wickham, Joe Cheng)
- trust & willingness to learn together

???

Finally, I have to talk about our team. 

We were able to do all of this not only because of the tools, but because of the people involved. 

---
map? 

???

At this point, like I said, OHI is used by 20 groups around the world, and will be included in the UN's ocean indicators for the Sustainable Development Goals. 

This would not have been possible without #rstats. 

We are a streamlined team, able to onboard and offboard teammembers, we work well together, and we are able to iterate from past work and enable others. 

By 2018, I had been working for 5 years, not only to help with the global assessments, but to co-develop and lead the program for the independent groups. 

We had published the Nature paper, and could see it being well-received in some circles. 

But I wanted to actually help other teams do this themselves. 

transition: that's when I got the Mozilla Fellowship and started Openscapes.

Openscapes is a program to welcome environmental scientists to become champions for ODS.

Openscapes

Selection requirements: 

early career scientific leads (col 1)
- faculty
- lecturers
- program managers
- etc

- rising star, influential scientists that can also become ambassadors for ODS
- not yet engaged in open data science
- trust that I will not waste their time

I decided to focus on early career scientific leaders for a few reasons
But I was also having a lot of one-on-one conversations with colleagues of mine, friends from grad school who were now running their own labs. 

Early career PIs might not yet know about the Force. They may have struggled through like Luke in their PhDs, worked their butts off to secure faculty jobs, and are now leading their own teams. How about focusing on them?


---

Explicit statement:::::::
there's this aspect of open tools and the aspect of community. and we want this to be both. transition in the analogy: but once luke learned to use the force, he didn't go out adn defeat the empire on his his own. he needed his community. 

We need to focus on the tools and also on the community. 



<!---
If we can do that in science — 

it's not tools, it's mindset. It's about seeing what's possible and being welcomed in. And I've been thinking about it not only from the data analysis and data science side, which is huge. 

transition: But in terms of welcoming environmental scientists, I've been thinking about it from the communication and culture side as well. 

---
R for science communication and culture

R has not only changed my analytical life, it's changed what's possible with science communication as well. and I think it can also change scientific culture; we can replicate/bring/remix what we have here in the #rstats community to environmental science, so that we put people first and can tackle these environmental issues. 

I'm going to tell you about an example of each: what's possible for env science and also for culture

---
nature paper screenshot

???

In a 2017 paper I led with my team, trying to be an example of what this can look like in science. 
we described how ODS helped us do better science in less time, how over the course of 4 years we incrementally introduced #rstats and github into our workflows and how it impacted the work we do and who uses it. And we identified 2 barriers: exposure and confidence. 

rstats is still not part of the culture of environmental science, so the 
There is a lack of exposure to what is possible, and a lack of confidence 

As a scientist, there are not a ton of pathways there, 

We found this on our own, had to seek it out. No one told us. Not a thing that is in the culture of science. 

transition: but what if it could be? so I want to give a two examples: what could this look like in environmental science? and how can we help welcome more scientists in?

---
# what does #rstats ethos look like in environmental science?

# how can we welcome others?  what if science prioritized community?

#



What's cool is that it opens up what communication can mean for science. It can make it more interactive, quicker. Science communication can mean publishing a peer-reviewed paper, it can mean talking with a journalist. It can mean tweeting, giving talks, etc. But now, with R, it can mean publishing books. It can mean 



???


how can we bring this welcoming and supportive culture to researchers in environmental science specifically who have such inmportant questions to answer but don't have the skillsets


I've been thinking a lot about having confidence with software leads to a more open and confident community. And how it's been this missing piece for scientists. What makes this happen is an investment in people and culture and community. 


transition:: what would it look like?

???
So that is my work to this point, I'm fundraising to be able to lead Openscapes full-time, and am co-leading our OHI internship program. 

But I wanted to end with what we can all do to become leaders in our communities.


How do we motivate others?

Talk about and show your colleagues how R makes you 

- a data scientist

but also 

- an author
- a web designer
- a designer
- a community member
- a leader

Say this to your colleagues: R makes me xyz
