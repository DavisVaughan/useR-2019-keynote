NO UM START >> WELL

Well thank you so much, I am so excited to be here with all of you and I want to thank the organizers for this invitation. 

I am a marine scientist and R as a language and as a community has been game-changing for my science, and my life. 

So much so that over the past six years I have been moving away from doing my own research so I can pay forward what I've learned and focus on enabling other scientists to better science in less time, together. 

Throughout this I've learned several lessons, and I want to share them up front: 

---
class: inverse
# Lessons learned 
<br>

### Open data science is a mindset
### Teamwork starts with openness 
### Harness the power of welcome

???

The 3 lessons are Open data science is a mindset, Teamwork starts with openness, and Harness the power of welcome.  

I'm going to spend the whole talk building out these lessons.

But first I wanted to tell a bit about me and the main experiences that have driven these lessons. 

I am often asked why a marine scientist would use R, and I aim to share why it's important that marine scientists do, as well as environmental scientist more broadly. 

So let me start off when I was a graduate student in a marine research group, which we also call laboratories in the US.

I am actually a squid ecologist, which is why my Twitter handle is juliesquid. 

That is me on the right, holding a squid that can be nearly as big as I am. 

I'm releasing it back into the ocean with an electronic tag on it, so as it swims around it will collect data for me like at little oceanographer. 

My whole PhD research group focused on squid; squid have huge impact on ecosystems because they eat a lot and grow quickly and economies because globally there is such high consumption of calamari.

Our research required a lot of teamwork, both at sea and in the laboratory. 

We were a typical research group that worked like a team about our scientific questions. 

But we didn't act like a team when it came to data. Analyzing data was something that was left to each of us to figure out as individuals.  

In in all my education I had never learned computing or how to work responsibly with data. So for me it was a super demoralizing experience to get the tag back and actually hold data in my hand but not be able to analyze it.

transition: It felt like this.

This is Luke Skywalker after he crashed his plane in the swamp on Degobah. 

He cannot solve the the challenge in front of him with the skillsets he has. 

He is demoralized and alone. And if you imagine him attempting to use whatever pulleys and ropes he might have with him, you know it wouldn't be pretty, it wouldn't be reproducible, and it probably wouldn't get him where he needs to be on time. 

transition: but luckily what happens next is that he meets Yoda

Yoda uses the Force to solve Luke's problem in a way Luke never imagined was possible. 

This is going to open up Luke's whole world because he can learn from Yoda and not only solve his current but it will broaden his mind to what is possible in the future. 

transition: But Luke didn't go on to defeat the Empire himself, he had a whole community.

R is the Force that enables us as scientists to do better science in less time. 

It empowers us to get our own data out of the swamp. 

It empowers us and build off of our confidence and experiences and broaden the scope of scientific challenges that we can tackle, which for environmental scientists, includes food security, disease transmission, and climate change. 

For me, I didn't fully feel the power of R until I finished graduate school and joined a research group where I am today, where we learned to work with data as a team.

The Ocean Health Index is a scientific endeavor to quantify impacts and benefits of oceans around the world using the best publically available data. 

It is being used by the United Nations and by 20 groups around the world. 

There is a lot to it but what is relevant here is that we combine lots of data, we repeat our analyses every year, and we do it as a team.

But we are marine scientists, and we were never trained to work responsibly with data. 

So we found out the hard way that our default approaches were not reproducible by even ourselves. 

Getting through this involved quite a reckoning, but when we got through it, we knew we had a story to tell.

We found our path to better science in less time with open data science tools. 

And by this I mean R and GitHub and friends. 

transition: We shared how these tools enabled us to more reproducible science faster each year, as we illustrated in this figure

We couldn't overhaul everything all at once, but focused on different pieces incrementally each year. 

We started off focused on R and RStudio, and then on using Git and GitHub, then on tidy data and then documentation and Rmd. And ever since we've focused on leading a training program to teach students how to maintain it. 

Having all of this coding infrastructure in place is what enables those 20 independent groups I mentioned to study ocean health in the places they care about. 

But just like Luke, we were able to do this because of community.

class: center, middle
```{r community-logos, out.width = '100%', fig.align='center'}

```

???

These communities in particular have been so transformative for our work. 

So many of you in this room and listening around the world have welcomed us and supported us and enabled us. 

And like I said, I've been paying it forward by teaching with the Carpentries, leading local study groups and RLadies chapters, and generally telling everybody how awesome R is. 

This is how I got a fellowship with Mozilla.

This is the vision I see for environmental science. 

Where the elements that environmental scientsts are great, like theory, and experimental design are streeamlined together by ODS, and result in helping inform decisions to our most challenging environmental problems. 

And this can be streamlined with ODS because because R streamlines how we work with data, and also streamlines how we work with each other because it gives us a common language and mindset. 

I know this graphic looks familiar from R4DS, but notice that all of the data science components here are ringed by communities and support that our OHI team has found so critical to our success. 

So this is the vision I'm working towards with Openscapes, amnd I am optimistic we can make this happen because Openscapes participants are well on their way after only 5 months.

But right now environmental science looks like this. We rarely have formal training with coding or computing or data and so folks learn in pockets and are unsupported at broader institutional levels. 

And often they are not supported even at level of the research group, which is already poised to work like a team. 

Helping complete this picture drives my work now. I want to figure out how to best introduce open data science and teamwork to this picture.

I've found that scientists are often not aware of what tools are availabe. But that is just the first sliver of the challenge. 

The real challenge is about mindset around open data science, and helping scientists feel included so that it can be part not only of their future, but of their present. 

So with Openscapes I work with scientists to welcome them to what open data science can look like for them, and I help them start paths to making it happen. 

Because OHI is one of the most visible examples of what this can look like, I rely heavily on it as motivition and examples, and I'll do that for the rest of the talk as well as we walk through the lessons learned. 

---
class: inverse
# Lessons learned
<br>

### Open data science is a mindset
### Teamwork starts with openness 
### Harness the power of welcome 

???

<water>

So the first is that open data science is a mindset. 

---
class: inverse, center, middle
# Open data science is a mindset

### expect a better way • build confidence & willingness • reimagine science communication

???

<br>

This involves expecting there is a better way with data science, 

Building confidence & willingness with open science, 

and reimagining what is possible with the available tools. 

ODS is an incredibly creative and collaborative thing, and it fueled by what is possible with the internet. 

---
class: middle, center
# Expect there is a better way

???

It can be really hard to expect that there is a better way to do something when you do not know what is possible and you don't see any examples within your own context. 

It's like how Luke would have never expected the Force to have been a thing if he hadn't run into ObiWan and Yoda. 

When I struggled with my squid data, I couldn't expect there was a better way because I thought my challenges with column renaming was a part of my squid research, not something separate like data wrangling. 

So this mindset drained weeks of my time, because I didn't have the mindset or the vocabulary to articulate my struggles and ask for help. 

transition: so when I talk about data science with Openscapes — 
---
```{r data-science}
```
.whisper[Data science] 

???

I make it clear that it is not just about big data, machine learning, and artifical intelligence, which is basically all you ever hear about in the news. 

I think this narrow definition really excludes scientists, who then feel that data science tools are not meant for them. 

transition: I like this definition: 

---
```{r data-science}
```
.whisper[Data science is the discipline of turning raw data into understanding] 
  
<br>

```{r data-science-r4ds, out.width = '90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/r4ds_data-science.png")
```
  
.footnote[
source: [Wickham & Grolemund](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
]  

???

This definition resonates with me because I can see myself included in it — and then with the graphic I can actually walk through the steps. 

This clearly describes what many scientist like me I have been fumbling around trying to every time from scratch. 

The idea of tidying your data first and then being streamlined with the tools you can use for science is amazing. Rather than accommodating around weird data.

transition So expecting there is a better way is a big part of a shifting mindset towards open data science. And along with it comes

---
class: middle, center
# Build confidence & willingness

???

Building confidence & willingness to engage in a completely different way to work. 

Open science is a big part of this confidence and willingness to engage. 

transition: but Open science has many different definitions and even more interpretations. 

---
```{r open-science}
```
.whisper[Open science]

???

For many environmental scientists, open science can be a negative thing. It's seen as extra work and high risk on already overburdened scientists, particularly those who are early career. 

And that is because it often also has a narrow definition of sharing your data and code at the end of your study, at the risk of people stealing your work and misconstuing your science. 

In this narrow mindset it's not considered that open science could ever be a benefit to the scientist who pays such cost in terms of time and risk.

transition: So in Openscapes, we talk about open science with this definition: 

---
```{r open-science}
```
.whisper[Open science is the concept of transparency at all stages of the research process, coupled with free and open access to data, code, and papers]

```{r spectrum, out.width = '90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/spectrum-haha.png")
```

.footnote[
source: [Hampton et al. 2015](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/ES14-00402.1)
]

???

I like this definition of open science

I teach that open science is a spectrum, with many entryways to engage

I like this too because it helps dispell the idea that you're either doing open science or you're not, but that you can always engage more as you are able.

In Openscapes we talk about how entryways can include sharing slides from a talk online. 

We also practice working openly with their own teams, even if it is within a private repository, because it is practicing the tools and taking the first steps. 

transition: and these 2 pieces really trigger you to reimagine what data science and open science can do for communication

---
class: center, middle
# Reimagine science communication

???

In environmental science, communication is something we really value. 

We are very similar to the open source community like R and Moz in that all of our work is for the public good, and thus communication about it is critical

transition: But For a lot of people, science communication still largely occurs at the end of a study, when everything is complete. 

---
.whisper[Communication tools]

???

And I think this mindset is rooted in the fact that for a long time, sharing your work was hard to do. 

It involved a lot of bookkeeping and formatting and physically printing in many cases, and then distribution was also limited to mail, either phyical or electronic. 

But the internet provides amazing channels to share our work not only at the end, but throughout all of the process. This is critical to establish trust and action for environmental solutions.

.whisper[Communication tools]

```{r ods-software, out.width = '65%', fig.align='center'}

]

???

So these are the communication tools I use for open data science — it is a small suite, primarily based with R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub. 

And keeping it so simple really streamlines how manageable it is to focus on science communication, because we use the exact same tools for analysis.

I may as well also say that I can be a big curmudgen about introducing extra software into my life and having to create new user accounts. 

I remember in one NSSD episode, Roger Peng said that if he has to create a new user account, he's like 50% out. For me it's like 80%. 

But anyways, these tools have reimagined what communication means, and I'll show you a few examples from the OHI.

We put all of our code online, pubically, in a GitHub organization for the OHI. This means that others can discover, access, and run our code, understanding what we've done and doing assessments of their own. 

But GitHub repositories are not a friendly landing page for everyone. So —

in our calls, I try to model the behavior i want to see, so that they can bring it to their labs. their homework is to have specific meetings in their labs, and start to seed this culture more broadly 

Evseteryone is starting from didfferent places, so progress differs, and outcomes differ. Someone might start using github for the first time. Or google drive. Some might start a #tidytuesday coding club or

Teams to me means rings of people you respect, collaborate with, and can rely upon. It does not have to be limited to a certain deliverable, location, discipline or anything else. 

Teamwork is critical in science because no one it can do it all. and for the sake for innovation as well as for emotional well-being. And that is because no one can do it all, and we need to shed the expectation that we should. 

There are some blurred lines here but one of the cooles things to me is how teamwork and collaboration and leadership and community all intertwine when you work openly.

They do cutting edge work on global food systems, human health ecology dajfdlk and teaching the next generation of environmental masters students.

We all meet twice each month to discuss open data science concepts and to build community as we try weaving these practices into our every day work.

Critical to learn something new together. 

We work really openly with each other. We co-develop things, we share early drafts, and we are constantly giving feedback and iterating with each other. 

What is it? it's about feeling the tension and finding the balance

These can be hard. On on individual level, it can take some soul searching. But critical for a team. There is mindset involved here too.

trust & assuming best intentions

respecting each other's time.

innovation & learn from failure

# Lab culture

### Code of Conduct
### Onboarding
### Seaside Chats 
### Lab Hackathons


???

Thnk about this in terms of individuals and tone they set as a team

deliberate

It's about thinking what Future You might need but also what Future Us might need. 

coopted the idea of hackathons, where we will all drop our own projects and come together for a day or an afternoon to do something that will benefit the whole group. but is no one's responsibility directly

So this is where we will actually overhaul our filepath conventions or refactor and modernize all our code with dplyr instead of plyr. 

In both seaside chats and hackathons we've also developed written protocols for onboarding new teammembers so that they can get upskilled and in our workflow as soon as possible.

With Openscapes, we've discussed doing hackathons to put data in one place and write data dictionaries and metadata.

So a few examples of what Champions have done here: 

- Wood lab seaside chats

- Pinsky lab CoC and cookbook

- Nina pathway


transition: one final thing that we do as an OHI team, and that is critical, is that we prioritize social time


transition: So this is all critical to operating like a team and being able to engage effectively and collaboratlively with ODS

And this team culture was ignited and nurtured by really supportive leadership.

TODO Lang see below



This is Ben Halpern, he's the lead of OHI and also the director of NCEAS, the ecology center where we are based. 

He set this tone for our team, and has played a huge role in our data science even though he is not a coder himself. 

And this is really critical. 

As a leader he listened to our excitement and he supported us to invest time and resources in open data science, and he trusted us to implement shared practices for our team.

He's making environmental data science a priority at NCEAS, and has also spearheaded a new masters program in environmental science at the University of California 

transition: so with Openscapes, I also mentor the research group leads individually so that they can become champions for open data science and have an oversized influence like Ben has had. 

////



We all had agency and support to become leaders within our lab group, and beyond. 

This is Ben Best, Jamie Afflerbach and me. They are my teammates but they have also been  leaders for me. Ben spent countless hours sitting with me and teaching me R and was patient when I deliberately made emails from github go to my spam folder because I thought GitHub was not going to be useful to me. 

And Jamie is an amazing leader as well, I'll tell a story about her in a moment. 

And together we are partners in crime. We cofounded EDS with other friends and have taught multiple carpentries workshops together. This is us preparing for the Shiny conference in 2016. 

transition: Enabling this kind of leadership within teams is what I try to ignite with Openscapes.

And Michelle Stuart is an excellent example. She is actually here at useR, where is she?
 
She is in the Pinsky lab and spearheads their seaside chats. She made a GitHub account during one of our Openscapes calls and then helped others in the lab do so as well. 

So she has become not only become a leader within the Pinsky Lab, she has become a lead in the broader community.

# Community

Open data science communities are online and in person, and they break down boundaries between traditional disciplines.

I used to have my feet squarely in the marine science community, but now I feel like a bridge across environemtnal science, R community and the Mozilla communities. 

I've learn so much from each and try to help channel those lessons between groups.

My teammate Jamie encouraged to join twitter to learn R. 

I was definitely skeptical. I did not use Twitter because I thought it was a megaphone for angry people. 

But she taught me how to use it to to listen and learn from other others. And then to gradually build up the courage to like and retweet things. 

And that this was not only a way to become part of the community yourself, but it was a way to welcome and amplify other people who might be unsure of what they were doing too.  

So I was amazed that you could have community on Twitter

And I was also amazed that developers were real people. And not only that, they were super nice people that made me feel welcome and valued even as I was doing, there, or in life more generally

Prior to these conversations, I had never stopped to think that there were real people behind software.

So, rOpenSci and RStudio. I'm deliberately limiting myself by putting them on the same slide here because I could talk about both of them. 

They have been so supportive and welcoming fromt the get go. And it was so exctiging to be able to particitae in unconfs and dev conferences

They have created communities where developers and new users who are strangers become collabortors and friends and where there is deliberate attention to setting the right space to make that happen. 

It was a big deal to not only connect online, but also in person, with so many other people in these communiies. It really solidified that we were part of this. And I wanted Openscapes to have this same opportunity

So midway through the Openscapes program, we were able to get the research leads together in person in California. 

Not only this give them an opportunity to meet each other as scientists who are engaging in open data science, but we tried replicate what I have experienced at rOpenSci and RStudio conferences and we included Sean from the R community and Christie Bahlai from the Mozilla community. 

So I had high expections about how awesome this would be but they were exceeeded. 

Up to this point they understood that all of this was powerful and they knew I was really excited about it, but they left the summit actually feeling it for themselves.

RLadies is changing the world, starting off by increasing gender diverstity in the R community. 

And so when we talk about this in Openscapes, it's not only to encourage scientists to become a part of RLadies, but to kicks-start this kind of movement in science. 

RLadies as a global program and as so many individual has given given me confidence in myself, and made me be a better advocate for women in science.

data science and teamwork exist together in a feedback loop that streamlines how we work and innovate. 

Learning and using similar software promotes and streamlines teammwork. And also working as a team better equips you to learn open practices data science.

You really need both. Trying to engage solely with open data science without teamwork can be lonely and deflating. And only as a team but without the best collaborative software can be inefficient.

And that there will be more support from institutions and universities to teach this formally. because Openscapes is not the ultimate solution, it's a bandaid.

in a time when env sci is our most pressing probs are related to env it's critical that those scientits have the tools and team to answer those quiestions using data.
