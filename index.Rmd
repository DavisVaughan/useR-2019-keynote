<!---KEEP IN MIND

Environmental scientist doing research. "How can we bring this to science" is way too big
When I say science = = "bring #rstats to science" what does that mean
"when I say bring to science the level I'm talking about is here"

I am a marine ecologist, and #rstats has been game-changing for my science and my life.

I am a marine ecologist, and #rstats has been game-changing for my science and my life. I'm going to tell you a bit about my story and my path and how we can all change science << keep this super clean/polished as opening statement

pic montage of me with squid, and with tags

???

I studied Humboldt squid expanding range, why? How? To answer these questions, I learned a lot about oceanography, how temperature, oxygen availablilty, nutrients, and currents work in the Pacific. I learned about squid, how they move, etc. I studied the ecology, the fisheries. Collaborated with a lot of scientists 

The data I collected was from this tag: little oceanographer! Sampling at every second: you can see them breath, since they move by jet propulsion and their breathing is coupled with swimming. 

But I pretty quickly realized how that I was literally holding this data in my hand but not trained to responsibly use it. 

In all of our formal education whether you're a marine biologist like me, or you study freshwater and drought, or disesase transmission in ecosystems, we are rarely taught how to code. So we are all responsible for doing the best we can, and we spend a lot of time creating our own bespoke approaches to analyzing data. 

I did learn how to code in Matlab but I think it was the wrong way: it was a struggle, by myself, alone, and just to get the job done. Coding let me complete my thesis, and my work in impactful. And while I"m proud of my work, I'm not proud of my code. It was a painful time in my life. And like most environmental scientists. It's something that I see across the board, it's something we all struggle with. 


transition: I like to talk about this with star wars.

Luke

???

<<Careful saying "scientists" generally w/o qualifier

Luke demoralized. If we imagine for a moment that he went ahead and took this on by himself, you could imigine it wouldn't be very pretty, it would take a long time, not reproducible. he wouldn't be very proud of it But he would eventually get his plane flying again, and he could be proud of that, but he wouldn't want to tell people how he'd done it. He would leave all of his pullees and levers in cupboard somewhere.  And he'd be limited by how much he could contribute by the time he got back to the game. 

To bring this back to environmental science, that is how it feels like — stranded with data. I'm not saying people don't do great science. But we don't get to see inside their cupboard. They are nervous to share how they got there. In terms of their code. They share their scientific methods.  

(QUESTION: would it be funny to have arrows that say "environmental scientists, data" and "#rstats")

transition: But it doesn't have to feel like this. // what *can* this feel like instead?

Yoda



???

ODS, Yoda, and Luke can learn
and then you can become the mentor
this doesn't come individually, this comes from supportive environments.

Yoda has a skillset that can solve luke's problem never imagined. Luke can learn and will go on to solve this problem, but in less time and he's able to show up at the right time. And then, it will open his mind to what is possible and the challenges he can take on. 

This is what rstats and more broadly open data science, feels like. It is so powerful for science and the skills and tools are so critical. 


ODS is this celebratory thing. 
But if he had had to use levers and pullies, he would have put that all in a cupboard. 
turn off the auto-guidance system. 

transition: But also a super important part is that it's not just about the tools (Force) and the people that know them (Jedis).

Hands

???

It's about the whole movement. It's about working together with people from different backgrounds and skillsets and having many ways to contribute. 

<!---Going back to science — environmental science doesn't feel like this to me right now. We're not a team, we are fragmented. --->

transition: But this is us, the people in this room. This is #rstats, this is for me the broader open data community.

---
# /#rstats
Hands w/ logos: RStudio, rOpenSci, RLadies, Carpentries, Mozilla


???

Our #rstats community is this mix of people from diverse backgrounds and experiences, innovating and learning together, and really doing so much more together. 

What's different about our #rstats community is that we put people first. We've put a big emphasis on communication and culture

Transition: We are focused on a positive experience where we support each other. 

Welcome each other and stand up for each other. This creates a positive space for us to teach each other, learn together, and innovate together. And because of it, we are stronger. We are better innovators. 

This has been so impactful for me as a scientist, to feel so welcomed, included, and supported.
Because of the people here in this room and the examples they have set, both in R and around R. It has totally changed the way I do science and the way I think about what is possible. 

I am so lucky to be a part of this community. It has empowered me and helped me build confidence that translates well beyond code. It has made me feel part of a bigger movement.

And I think for a lot of us, we are so lucky to have #rstats community but it is not necessarily the way our day-to-day communities that we work with operate. 


transition: How do we extend the #rstats culture to our other communities?

# How do we extend the #rstats culture?

???

How can we become leaders in our own spaces/domains and help bring these values and collaborative, innovative spirit? I think about this a lot in env science, and I want to share some strategies that we can try in other science domains and outside of science too. 

I've been thinking a lot about how we can welcome more people to r and rstats community, but also how we can extend this culture to other communities.  We are all parts of different communities and we are all passionate about rstats, we can become leaders. 

transition: In environmental science —

We focus around our domain and communication. And we do this really well. 

transition: But we are missing —

---
R4DS complete

???

We are missing data science. And not only the tools, but the mindset and culture that comes with those tools. there are still not a lot of pathways here. And the culture as a whole does not feel like this — we do not put our values forward, we do not think of people and community. 
How do we make this part of the norm? 

I think focusing on teamwork and culture is key. 
If we can help people feel included and supportive within their existing teams, and show what is possible and have people see themselves in that narrative, they will have confidence that this is a good way forward. If they value it and not only want to put in the time to learn on their own, but will help champion it for others and help this become part of the curriculum for what it means to be an environmental scientist. 

So this means showing them not only R for analysis, but R for communication and culture.

For the rest of the talk I'll share an example of what it can look like for a team to essentially start from scratch and become a visible example of impact. And I'll share about how to try to replicate this with other teams. Throughout I will emphasize how this is not unique to env science, or science. It's about leadership from all sides, teamwork, and about using r for communication and culture

OHI measure illustration

The ocean health index measures what matters. 

This is an ambitious project. We set out to be the best approach because to bring data to marine policy. We didn't set out to be the best approach for what open data science could look like in environmental science, but we did as well. 

OHI is essentially a blueprint. We've been leading assessments at the global scale, UN. 
We also have enabled 20+ countries and gvts around the world.

<!---
If we can do that in science — 

it's not tools, it's mindset. It's about seeing what's possible and being welcomed in. And I've been thinking about it not only from the data analysis and data science side, which is huge. 

transition: But in terms of welcoming environmental scientists, I've been thinking about it from the communication and culture side as well.

R for science communication and culture

R has not only changed my analytical life, it's changed what's possible with science communication as well. and I think it can also change scientific culture; we can replicate/bring/remix what we have here in the #rstats community to environmental science, so that we put people first and can tackle these environmental issues. 

I'm going to tell you about an example of each: what's possible for env science and also for culture

nature paper screenshot

???

In a 2017 paper I led with my team, trying to be an example of what this can look like in science. 
we described how ODS helped us do better science in less time, how over the course of 4 years we incrementally introduced #rstats and github into our workflows and how it impacted the work we do and who uses it. And we identified 2 barriers: exposure and confidence. 

rstats is still not part of the culture of environmental science, so the 
There is a lack of exposure to what is possible, and a lack of confidence 

As a scientist, there are not a ton of pathways there, 

We found this on our own, had to seek it out. No one told us. Not a thing that is in the culture of science. 

transition: but what if it could be? so I want to give a two examples: what could this look like in environmental science? and how can we help welcome more scientists in?

# what does #rstats ethos look like in environmental science?

# how can we welcome others?  what if science prioritized community?

What's cool is that it opens up what communication can mean for science. It can make it more interactive, quicker. Science communication can mean publishing a peer-reviewed paper, it can mean talking with a journalist. It can mean tweeting, giving talks, etc. But now, with R, it can mean publishing books. It can mean 



???


how can we bring this welcoming and supportive culture to researchers in environmental science specifically who have such inmportant questions to answer but don't have the skillsets


I've been thinking a lot about having confidence with software leads to a more open and confident community. And how it's been this missing piece for scientists. What makes this happen is an investment in people and culture and community.

Environmental scientists are doing really critical and amazing work. Solving these problems.  << Remember to cut words always

They are trained to do their science and get policy changed. 

They are trained in domain and comms but there is this huge missing piece. 
transition:



How do we motivate others?

Talk about and show your colleagues how R makes you 

- a data scientist

but also 

- an author
- a web designer
- a designer
- a community member
- a leader

Say this to your colleagues: R makes me xyz
