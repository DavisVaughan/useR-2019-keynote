<!---KEEP IN MIND

Environmental scientist doing research. "How can we bring this to science" is way too big
When I say science = = "bring #rstats to science" what does that mean
"when I say bring to science the level I'm talking about is here" 


TOO MANY WORDS> the most important things get lost if each is a full paragraph

each slide is 2-3 sentences. percision of speech. every word should be throughful and precise. to create emphasis of tihngs


instead of saying "i've been thinking a lot about" "the question I ask: how can we bring this ethos to env sci". That's been guiding my efforts

add one sentence: environmental problems are critical. what a bummer what they don't 

storyline is good in the intro. Stop changing it. This is good. Get the words nailed down so that they're great and precise. 

Then, we can talk about whether we don't talk about env science enough. WEDS

in next few days say intro bare bones.

I am a marine ecologist, and #rstats has been life-changing for me.

I am a marine ecologist, and #rstats has been life-changing for me. 

It has been so impactful for me as a scientist that I have been moving away from doing my own research so I can enable other scientists to do their science better in less time. 

I'll tell you a bit about me and my work using R for science communication and culture through two projects I have been leading: Ocean Health Index, which I've been a part of at NCEAS for 6 years, and Openscapes, which I've just developed over the past year as a Fellow with Mozilla. 

<< keep this super clean/polished as opening statement

pic montage of me at sea, mbari squid?

???

For my PhD, I studied a species of squid that can be as big as I am. 

It lives in the Pacific Ocean, traditionally from Chile to Mexico, and is one of the biggest fisheries in the world, which means that there are a lot of them, and we remove a lot of them from the ecosystem so that we can eat them and use them for agriculture and aquaculture. 

For about 15 years, they had extended their habitat range northward, into California where I was based, northern US, Canada, Alaska. 

My PhD research was to understand what they were doing and the impact they were having on our local ecosystems, and how climate change was involved.

To prepare for my field work, I learned about oceanography and how temperature, oxygen availablilty, nutrients, and currents work in the Pacific. 

I learned about squid, how they move, etc. I studied the ecology, the fisheries. 

transition: I got to collaborate with a lot of scientists and learn from them.

pic: tagging squid

???

My fieldwork involved going out to sea, catching squid, and releasing them back in the ocean with a data logger on them. They would become little oceanographers themselves, with the tags recording temp and depth as they swam. 

It was super cool. We collected data every second, which meant you'd be able to see them breath, since they move by jet propulsion and their breathing is coupled with swimming. 

---
pic: holding tag

???

So after all this work you can imagine how cool it was to get this data logger back and actually hold the data in my hand. 

But what happened then was that I quickly and sadly realized that even though i hold that data, I didn't have the tools or skillsets to to work responsibly with my data on my own. 

I felt so lonely and isolated. 

And the irony of that is that most environmental scientists feel that same way. 

We are studying some of the biggest challenges our planets face, and while we are experts on our study systems and theory, we are on our own for data analysis. 

We are rarely taught how to code or work responsibly with data. 

So we are all responsible for doing the best we can, and we spend a lot of time creating our own bespoke approaches to analyzing data. 

transition: To drive home what this feels like, I like to talk about this with star wars analogies.

Luke

???

<<Careful saying "scientists" generally w/o qualifier

This is the feeling we can see Luke having when he crashed his plane in the swamp. 

He is demoralized and alone, staring at a challenge that he cannot solve with the skillsets he has. 

He has no idea how to even begin this process. 

transition: but what happens next is that he meets Yoda 

<!---
**this is the feeling when you don't have the toolset. but you can learn when you have a community ** Don't overexplain the metaphore.
--->

Yoda


???

And Yoda has a skillset to solve this challenge in a better and more efficient way: he uses the Force. 
<!---didn't even know existed--->

The Force can solve Luke's problem in a way he never imagined. 

And Luke can learn from Yoda, and he will develop skills to not only solve this problem, but it will open his mind to what is possible and the challenges he can take on. 

<!---Luke's ability and successes don't come individually, this comes from supportive environments.--->

transition: But it is not just the tools that make Luke successful, it is the community that he is a part of. 

<!---But also a super important part is that it's not just about the tools (Force) and the people that know them (Jedis).--->

---
Hands

???

Luke's community is not made up of only Jedis with the same skillsets he has. This is a movement made up of diverse people (and droids, wookies, and whatever yoda is) from different backgrounds, and all of them contribute in really important ways. 

transition: So the Force is #rstats, or more broadly, it's open data science. And the community is us, the people in this room. 

---
# /#rstats
Hands w/ logos: RStudio, rOpenSci, RLadies, Carpentries, Mozilla


???

Our #rstats community is so amazing. 

It is welcoming, it is inclusive, it is supportive, it is empowering. 
<!---we stand up for each other--->

There is such a mix of people from diverse backgrounds and experiences, from all over the world, online and in person, innovating and learning together. 

What's different about our #rstats community is that we put people first. We've put a big emphasis on communication and culture

This has been so impactful for me as a scientist. Instead of feeling stranded in a swamp like I did when I was a PhD student, I am more powerful than I ever imagined. 

The people here in this room have helped me change the way I do science and the way I think about what is possible. They have empowered me and helped me build confidence that translates well beyond code. 

We are all here because we have been empowered by R as a tool and a community, but we can all probably think of others that are still feeling stranded and alone. We might work with them day-to-day. 

transition: So my question is — 

---
# How do we extend the #rstats culture?

???

How do we extend the #rstats culture and welcome more people?

There are so many communities that could be enriched not only by #rstats tools, but but #rstat culture. What the #rstats culture became the ethos for their communities as well? 

<!---
I think we can welcome them not only with the tools but with the culture. 

But we have to really understand 
Knowing that folks have a lot of responsibilities already and can feel isolated, and overwhelmed about coding, how do you welcome more people?

transition: I think about the way things work in environmental science —

R4DS fig minus hadley

We are really passionate experts in our domain science, and we are effective communicators, helping solve environmental challenges based on our science. 

But we still act a lot like individuals because we don't have a common culture or toolset. We are working on really complex, emotionally draining challenges, but we don't have a culture like we do with #rstats  

???

transition: But we could: 

---
R4DS complete

here's what I want to do about it. 

???

But this is what it could look like. 

If environmental scientists who already doing such important work, could be using the Force adn #rstats, and feeling great about it with the community and culture, it is really hopeful what we will be able to do. 

Right now one of the biggest obstacles to getting here is that it that coding and data analysis is not valued in the environmental science. I said before that we don't have a culture of teaching it but we do not have a culture of talking about it.  

A way forward is to increase the visibility of #rstats and its value. And not just R for analysis, but R for communication and culture.

And because we know how important community is, we can start with existing communities in science - the laboratory. 

If we can help labs operate like our #rstats community, they will also become champions within their broader communities and this will have a ripple effect throughout environmental science. 

For the rest of the talk I'll share what this can look like in environmental science labs, and how we can replicate this with other teams. 

And I also want to emphasize that although I am focusing on environmental science, these examples have relevance well beyond. We can all be leaders in our communities to welcome more people and teams to the welcoming power of #rstats.

# How the Ocean Health Index became an example of ODS

OHI measure illustration

???
The ocean health index measures what matters. 

This is an ambitious project. We set out to be the best approach because to bring data to marine policy. We didn't set out to be the best approach for what open data science could look like in environmental science, but we did as well. 

OHI is essentially a blueprint. We've been leading assessments at the global scale, UN. 
We also have enabled 20+ countries and gvts around the world.

Explicit statement:::::::
there's this aspect of open tools and the aspect of community. and we want this to be both. transition in the analogy: but once luke learned to use the force, he didn't go out adn defeat the empire on his his own. he needed his community. 

We need to focus on the tools and also on the community. 



<!---
If we can do that in science — 

it's not tools, it's mindset. It's about seeing what's possible and being welcomed in. And I've been thinking about it not only from the data analysis and data science side, which is huge. 

transition: But in terms of welcoming environmental scientists, I've been thinking about it from the communication and culture side as well. 

---
R for science communication and culture

R has not only changed my analytical life, it's changed what's possible with science communication as well. and I think it can also change scientific culture; we can replicate/bring/remix what we have here in the #rstats community to environmental science, so that we put people first and can tackle these environmental issues. 

I'm going to tell you about an example of each: what's possible for env science and also for culture

---
nature paper screenshot

???

In a 2017 paper I led with my team, trying to be an example of what this can look like in science. 
we described how ODS helped us do better science in less time, how over the course of 4 years we incrementally introduced #rstats and github into our workflows and how it impacted the work we do and who uses it. And we identified 2 barriers: exposure and confidence. 

rstats is still not part of the culture of environmental science, so the 
There is a lack of exposure to what is possible, and a lack of confidence 

As a scientist, there are not a ton of pathways there, 

We found this on our own, had to seek it out. No one told us. Not a thing that is in the culture of science. 

transition: but what if it could be? so I want to give a two examples: what could this look like in environmental science? and how can we help welcome more scientists in?

---
# what does #rstats ethos look like in environmental science?

# how can we welcome others?  what if science prioritized community?

#



What's cool is that it opens up what communication can mean for science. It can make it more interactive, quicker. Science communication can mean publishing a peer-reviewed paper, it can mean talking with a journalist. It can mean tweeting, giving talks, etc. But now, with R, it can mean publishing books. It can mean 



???


how can we bring this welcoming and supportive culture to researchers in environmental science specifically who have such inmportant questions to answer but don't have the skillsets


I've been thinking a lot about having confidence with software leads to a more open and confident community. And how it's been this missing piece for scientists. What makes this happen is an investment in people and culture and community. 


transition:: what would it look like?

Environmental scientists are doing really critical and amazing work. Solving these problems.  << Remember to cut words always

They are trained to do their science and get policy changed. 

They are trained in domain and comms but there is this huge missing piece.

How do we motivate others?

Talk about and show your colleagues how R makes you

but also 

- an author
- a web designer
- a designer
- a community member
- a leader

Say this to your colleagues: R makes me xyz

Openscapes

early career PIs might not yet know about the Force. They may have struggled through like Luke in their PhDs, worked their butts off to secure faculty jobs, and are now leading their own teams. How about focusing on them?
