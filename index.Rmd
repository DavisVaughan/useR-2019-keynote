KEEP IN MIND

Environmental scientist doing research. "How can we bring this to science" is way too big

each slide is 2-3 sentences. percision of speech. every word should be throughful and precise. to create emphasis of tihngs

no: "i've been thinking a lot about" yes: "the question I ask: how can we ..."

add one sentence: environmental problems are critical. what a bummer what they don't 

this is my work, I'm neck-deep if I am asking the question if this is ncessarry? The answer is no every time.

Need to anchor beginning

The community that R is a part of. We are from finance and science and developers!!! Community of Jedis Put faces

Ignore this: not many jedis, elite. Not eeveryone? But in the world of R everyone can be a jedi? Have a resonse

I mentioned data layers but didn't say data needs
Show our maps: maps are important for showing spatial things for communication
Cornwall website things: tell a story about Cornwell. Why are they doing this? In Cornwall they are having issues with overfishing

The fact that I'm goinving a talk aobout an R conf and never talked abou tthis at an ocean conf speaks to the imporatnce. 

I instead of we

My whole thing is a bout team. A big part of this is about my personal transoforamation but it's really about the team. So my  story is the team story. 

Ending::: need a super summary to bring back to my main message: teams and openness. End with the profound single statement. 
Now that you've heard all of this you can see how teams are so important. But need to end with core message

You can do open science without being part of a team so this is something I am trying to work at. Core message. Visual

It's not about fixing problems it's about making something good even bnetter

Nature 2012 had a huge impact. But now accelerated impact. But the fact that we do it better now doesn't mean it wasn't good science the first time, it's just better and faster now. 

Data challenges have gotten bigger. And tools are here to ameiliarte. In the past the tools weren't even necessary. Didn't have asatellites. NOw we are seeing . Everything is happening faster. Need tools to meet these challenges. Until fairly recently haven't been available for the normal humans to use. Everything has changed, we need to get with the program. 

it's not that the science we do now is bad, it's better because it's faster, more open, streamlined, inclusive. 

Reorg Allison notes Jun 27
Nail down pacing and no ums

A goodie for their brain. Places where you can remind people of what they've already lerned is awesome. And a great way to transition.

this will shorten OHI part and set up Openscapes
And then I say is this is a feedback loop intertwined and working together. Positive feedback loop. So it took us 4 years to realize this. How do we make it so that it isn't so terrible and long process for other labs. 

transitiongremind why you talked about OHI
so we spent 4 years learning how to work as a team using ODS tools. In Openscapes I wanted to decrease that effort. That's waht drives Openscapes. get you from that big circle to the smaller circle in less time. 

Openscapes recipe connect this to the lessons learned from OHI> 
aspects of leadership and community
Cut the cohort summary. 
Cut the wods in the openscapes labs. 
*****They want to know the lessons learned. **** more imp than details. 
My personal story then OHI's story then Openscapes story and here's what I've learned throught his process so that
weekly meetings with calls, the point is doing this. 
CUT WORDS. a few high-impact sentences on each lessons learned.

Call to action part
return to loop
Yes we can learn the data science tool and when it comes to team building
Mindset shift to get into it. 
Empathy
Keep in minds soemthing i think is surprising: people we look at who are doing really amazing env science might be really intimidated by data science and they might need to be welcomed. 
Just bc someone is a brillant env scientce, they might still need help welcoming bc they are doing some of the toughest stuff in the world right now. 
< big pic recap: people answering raelly imporant qs in en sci don't always have the tool and teams they neeed but there are ways to welcome and empoer them to do bettere science in less time. 

comfortable not broadening past env sicent
env science should be a thing that intersts everyone
Qs: do you think this is true in othere fieelds? 
A: yes absolutely

Make big high-impact statement. OHI is a big deal. don't worry about overstating. make it a keynote. 



////
Q for Allison:

- Dolphin pic — too much? have multiple (ok this is what it's like)
- Nature figure 1, use original? Or simplified?
- Twitter stuff: how to include the hadley wizard quote? clippy? rOpenSci?


June 30 Notes from Allison
Good until Openscapes. 
If I put a picture of me and a squid you will need a sentence of what I'm doing. THis is me with a swud
Great transitions for intro!
ON the R4DS drawing: added credit updated from Wickham & Gr
super cleaned polished streamlined cutting words. But don't lose my enthusiam bc it's succinct
If I feel like I'm monotoned don't worry, i'll be more excited
OHI: worried about absolute stateents. OHI is '''one of the most visible'''. be careful not to make anyone defensive. 
need transiton bt describing OHI and and then to the paper intro. Maybe just wording, "so we wrote a paper about it" sounds aweful. We realized we wereon't the only team strugglin with data. so much that we published our story so other groups can learn from that. 
BSILT table and figures. When I show table: i'm not going through all of this and you don't need to read it. But our main shifts are these. 
Open source science >> good, keep. A strong
ANother ool thing we were trying to improve our own data science efforts but by createing packages and documentation and workflows but these empowered other researchers to do their own assessments on their own coastlines. 
Openscapes nail down transitions
Talk about seaside chats. These are separte meetings specifically about data. In our other lab meetings. We had to create a space to focus on the data. 
Make sure this still sounds like a story. Intro and OHI sounds like a story. Openscapes doesn't sound like a story. "we do this, also this", not intesting. 
Focus on what is the story of openscapes and whay is it so valuable and what comes out of it that proves that it's working. What is the big picture keynote worthy
Openscapes: other resarchar labs shouldn't have to figure this out on their own. they should customize a basic wheel so they have to create it from scratch. They shouldn't have to figure it out all on their own like we did with OHI

SEtup from OHI: Openscapes will be less painful and long for other groups. SEt this up by saying: if i had to generalize, the 2 main things we had to overcome in order to make this progr: we were unawarre of and benefit from open tools, and we weren't prioritizing teamowkr and culture in labs. These are the 2 problems that ware really common across env science reaseerch labs. 
What we realized is that both of these end points arentbeing addressed in reaserch labs and how they are connecteed wasn't discussed. So the dev and interconnectedness of both of these. And how it realtes to openscapes. OPENSCAPES IS MAKING THIS WHEEL

that's the big picutre problem. 
Also liked the concrete lessons learned so if I could say these. From case studies: it's a big up front time investment but worth it. 

story idea: Build / structure: keep returning to this loop. The first side we want to focus on is culture and support. until we deal with this ds will be deflating. So for the frist 5 weeks we focused on the culture side of things. Now we transition from open and trusta nd honesty. Then, what are the tools we can use within that to do bsilt. These tools and these communities. We realized this awesome loop exists that adccelerates our science and our quality of life. If that's what Openscapes is based on, keep returning to it. How do these interact with each other. Explain the loop that this creates for labs. How openscapse closes this into a cohesive loop
THose things can't exist separately if you want to succesfful lab, it makes everyone more happy labs operate as teams, makes it more reproducble happier


Q for A Hill: 
- hyperlink images from knitr::include_graphics()?

Jul 1
careful with overlapping language
for the presentationI need to decide on teamwork, don't say the collab leadership without being careful
"we started acting like a team" what does that actually mean and how does it differ from the way we were working before. 
is it github using same stuff
is it emotional like you support and care about each other
to be useful for the audience 
people need to walk away with and think about in their own life. In your ideal world you can't control who is your team but what can you do after you walk away. Thinking about the loop. 
Tables are in the ODS loop. leadership and community that 
WHAT IS WORKING LIKE A TEAM. The PI needs to leave thinking about this. And how to keep the bins organized. GitHub and Issues are parts of ODS. But leadership and community are teamwork. It's those intangibles. interpersonal relationship
The importance of willingness in teamwork: people have to be willing to be on the team and work like a team. And put time into it. 

R4DS: valuable to point out that one diff is that all those components of r4ds exist around a band of community and support. SAY THIS. Notice that there is this thing you're used to seeing but around it are the communities that are so important. 

Openscapse section wordy CUT
If parallel OHI, you should say it. Don't make audiences work hard to make parallels. Spell it out. So like we experienced with OHI, based on our experience, we did xyz. reminders, repetition, drawing parallels are great, just spell them out. 

If I hate it just cut it

Teamwork side of loop. As an intermediate after I describe after openscapes and then on the teamwork side have bullets of the goals or outcomes are of that. 

bummer comment: when I'm showing the book and website am I teaching them something or am I showing something that I'm happy about. Instead saying: so I've been working with these cohorts and i'm happy what they accomplished. want to make this open for everyone as I go and be available. 
As part of doing ds and sharing and community building, and if you're intersted >> audeicne should know why this matters to them, not just hearing thatyou're saying it. Impact, not just the materials/deliverables. 
Offer these at the ends. Could be a last slide after lessons learned. 
I'm excited about it and even as this program is being developed something i'm committed to, with that in mind . Thank you so much. 

Start nailing down: need an awesome opening statement and really awesome ending statement. Big picture: what is this problem helping to 
in a time when env sci is our most pressing probs are related to env it's critical that those scientits have the tools and team to answer those quiestions using data. Memorize this and tempo. And what I'm offering as part of the solution. 

One of final slides
"this is powerful for science" >>> it's part of this for science. but it's also powerful for people. mental health, leaky pipeline, burnout. and maybe include this too. This is really powerful for science and individuals and teams. 

Good job leading it back to Luke with his mind broadened with ODS! << add this in the notes. 

Wording issue: lessons learned. I'd expect the lessons to fall out of what I've described. Welcome has not been discussed in the presentation. You need to be careful 
\Welcome: build it out more. Maybe "find or create welcoming communities" and then in this discussion refer to what you've already talked about. Getting your foot in the door is really critical
Jenny: another option. the Power of Welcome is catchy. HOw do I frame it though: think about those moments. introduction to rOpenSci. We are leveraging the power of welcome: that's what I received and paying it forward. 

What does make a team a team mean. Some people have played sports their whole lives and know aht it means. it has a feeling for them. But there are people who don't have that experience >> need tangible understanding of what that is. Offer counterpoints: here are examples as not working as part of a team. 
upskill, not having just 
there are a lot of aspects of working as a team. I'm going to focus on a few and to illustrate some progress I've made with as a team. 
Ways we weren't working as part of a team: we didn't even realized this wasn't teamly. :: 
and now we 
there are tons of env sci that outsource their data to 
you lose agency and control over the work. A person who knew how to work with data and invested the time. 
training, seaside chats, eco-data-science. and lifted ourselves up. 
On either end: I get slapped with everyone else's data

I need a response to teamwork that is separate from data science skills
Teamwork can be the act of skillsharing, empowering coworkers to do their own analyses
env scientists are used to working as teams in most aspects of their work. In the field, in the lab, when they're writing papers. but one way they don't think of working like teams is when it comes to data. 
Env scientists are good at teamwork because we have to be. we are answering big questions that require a lot of people to answer. but for some reason that teamwork that is so often in lab and field is not extended into data science. 

Jenny: With each section: what am I giving to my audience and is it clear to them

Qs from Allison: for audience
- what does acting like a team
- what is Opeancscapes doing to address eqity and diversity in env science
- what if there are leaders in labs that are resistant to sharing/collab/ods

From right now, cut all ums and ahs as I practice.

Well thank you so much, I am so excited with all of you and I want to thank the organizers for this invitation. 

I am going to talk today about how we can welcome more people to use R for better science in less time.  

transition: I am going to focus on welcoming marine and environmental scientists, so I wanted to start by giving a sense of what we do, because I know some of you might have your own ideas

Studies like these are done by environmental scientists. They are critical. 

And make it seem that science is a uniformed effort that streamlines data into results.

But science really operates in pockets, with individuals working within research groups and laboratories, as well as across them.

transition: research laborties are often around a theme or topic, like a species, place, or method. My PhD lab was like this.

# Squid lab pic

We were a squid lab, broadly interested to understand how squid interact with ecosystems and drive economies through fisheries, and how climate change is affecting all this. 

transition: Although we had the same anchor, all of us in the lab focused on different pieces of this broader interest.

I focused on adult behavior and migration, and how this is relevant to fisheries, conservation, and impacted by climate change

others studied physiology, neuroscience, vision, and camouflage, which is really important since we have learned a lot about human neurons through studying squid neurons

also about development of squid babies, that are only 1 mm long when they hatch but can grow to be nearly my size in less than a year, meaning they eat a lot.

This meant we did a lot of work at sea and in the lab. We would go fishing and catch and release squid that we tagged with electronic tags so they would turn into little oceanographers as they swam. 

---
# pic policy/presenting our work

Really incredible opportunities to learn about these animals and make a difference for fisheries, for ecology, for people. 

---
# funny pic?

???

But it's not so smooth going. Because in all my education I had learned about processes etc. I had never learned how to work responsibly with my data. 

And even though we are part of a lab, part of a group that is unified around science, it can be really lonely and isolating when it comes to data bc we don't have the skills, mindset, or support. It can be really intimidating to engage in data science and learn to code, especially when we also do not see examples of its benefits in our own context, and we are not aware of welcoming entry points to engage.

So open data science is the Force that enables us to do better science in less time. 

And the alliance is our community, everyone in this room. 

Having this our community has been so game-changing for me as a scientist. 

Instead of feeling stranded in a swamp like I have several times in my scientific career, I feel more powerful and supported than I ever imagined. 

And I want all environmental scientists to feel this powerful and supported.

For example, an ecologist might be studying how bees pollinate crops that are important for agriculture. 

To do this they might collect data on the biology, behavior, and genomics of different bee populations, and combine that with data on water availability from rain and snow. 

Their data would be a combination of observations, genetic sequencing, and sensor data on the ground and from satellites.

Their results help inform policy and management decisions around food systems, disease transmission, sustainability, and climate change. 

As environmental scientists, we are often working with governments at local and international scales to help inform change on the ground.

And we hhave a lot in common with the open source community because we are working for the public good, and passionate about our work. 

But data challenges have gotten bigger and faster; we are not trained to collect and manage and combine and analyze the types of data that we require to do our work.

The interplay of open data science and community can have resounding impacts on environmental science — because R streamlines how we work with data, and also streamlines how we work with each other. 

Making this a reality in environmental science requires changes in mindset for individual researchers and cultural change in research groups, which is a big task. 

But I know it is possible because I have lived through this mindset change myself, and for the past few years have been focusing on igniting this cultural change more broadly. 

transition: But over the last year with a fellowship from Mozilla, I've been focused on doing this more formally through program I've developed called Openscapes.

---
<br>

.pull-right[
![](img/openscapes-hex.png)

With Openscapes I'm focusing on igniting this cultural change at the core community unit of science, the research group or laboratory. 

Openscapes is a mentorship program, helping research groups engage with open data science and become visible examples and vocal ambassadors for its awesomeness within their broader communities. 

We've just completed the pilot cohort of this mentoring program with 7 research groups, and I'm excited to tell you all about it bc I am so proud of what they accomplished.

But to tell the Openscapes story I need to first tell the Ocean Health Index story. 

And that's because I designed Openscapes based on what our team experienced with the Ocean Health Index, and it is now probably the most visible example of how powerful open data science can be for environmental science.

With the OHI we are trying on a to better understand and quantify the health of our oceans on a global scale. 

To make this useful and actionable for policy, the OHI focuses on how the ocean provides benefits to people, and models it with the best publically available data and science.

"OHI is used by UN to try to quantify impacts and benefits" << that shuld be their takehome

From all of this, we create maps like these, with scores reflecting how healthy oceans are for every coastal country around the world. 

And ever since, we have repeated this work every year so that we could understand how ocean health changes through time. 

This is a really massive novel scientific undertaking, and for us, it also meant to do sound and reproducible data science

But we did not know how.

We were marine scientists using the tools and approaches we had learned along the way.

And we truly thought that this approach would be reproducible, and were pretty deflated when it was not

This is a figure from the paper showing how it took us less time each year to redo our work, and that it got easier to be reproducible and collaborate with others.

In 2012 it took us 3M, 4 years, and 20 team members. Now in 2019 it takes 250K, eight months, and 2 or 3 graduate student interns.

This change took time and and I think why it has really resonated with people is that we shared how hard this transition was for us. 

transition: Because we really face a reckoning with the way we worked with data, and we had to completely change the way we had always worked and seen other people work.

It took us a long time to categorize our work like this because it required abstracting data science steps from our ocean health index steps. 

We had never thought about what were data challenges universally held by everyone and what were science challenges we faced with ocean health. So teasing these apart and articulating them was a big part of this story.

# Reproducibility

```{r repro, eval=require('DT'), echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
table1 %>%
  dplyr::filter(Task %in% 
                  c("data preparation", "modeling", "version control", "organisation")) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    Then = "",
    Now = "",
    `Primary open data science tools` = "") %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")
```

.footnote[
[Lowndes *et al.* 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160)
]

???

We thought about our path to reprocibility as data prep, modeling, version control, and organization, thought about what we did before, now, and the tools we used. 

---
# Reproducibility

```{r repro-complete, eval=require('DT'), echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
table1 %>%
  dplyr::filter(Task %in% 
                  c("data preparation", "modeling", "version control", "organisation")) %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")
```

.footnote[
[Lowndes *et al.* 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160)
]

???
We had really been doing things by hand and with our own homegrown systems, so the biggest changes were using R and GitHub for everything, and having shared practices and conventions with the tidyverse and file storage. 

---
# Collaboration

```{r collab, eval=require('DT'), echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
table1 %>%
  dplyr::filter(Task %in% c("coding", "workflow and project management", "internal collaboration")) %>%
   dplyr::mutate(
    Then = "",
    Now = "",
    `Primary open data science tools` = "") %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")

```

.footnote[
[Lowndes *et al.* 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160)
]

???
We thought the same way about collaboration, thinking about our coding, workflows, and internal correspondance.

---
# Collaboration

```{r collab-complete, eval=require('DT'), echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
table1 %>%
  dplyr::filter(Task %in% c("coding", "workflow and project management", "internal collaboration")) %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")
```

.footnote[
[Lowndes *et al.* 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160)
]

???
Not only did shared convensions with R help our coding, but shared convensions with GitHub helped our project management and our documentation. 

Using GitHub for all of this was really helpful for onboarding new teammembers.

---
# Communication

```{r comm, eval=require('DT'), echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
table1 %>%
  dplyr::filter(Task %in% c("sharing data", "sharing methods")) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    Then = "",
    Now = "",
    `Primary open data science tools` = "") %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")

```

.footnote[
[Lowndes *et al.* 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160)
]

???
And finally for communication, we thought about this in terms of how we shared our data and methods. 

For scientists using traditional tools, communication is really limited to the end of a project when everything can be wrapped into a PDF and data put on a remote server somewhere.

---
# Communication

```{r comm-complete, eval=require('DT'), echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
table1 %>%
  dplyr::filter(Task %in% c("sharing data", "sharing methods")) %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")

```

.footnote[
[Lowndes *et al.* 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160)
]

???

But communication changed for us because we could put everything online. All our code and data are online throughout the process, and we were able to create websites and share things along the way, not only at the end. 

This is a huge deal for environmental science, since there are so many different audiences involve and being able to communicate as data decisions are being made rather than only at the end is huge.

transition: so what this all looks like is

And we have had over 20 groups using our science and our code to do OHI assessments in the places they care about.

# Teamwork

I'm going to call this teamwork but it could be collaboration, community. 
Community and leadership were an enormous part of our success. I think about it in terms of 3 things:

# Supportive leadership

???

we had supportive leader who empowered us to focus on ds. 

something critical here was that he trusted us to learn and implement data science architecture for our reasearch team.

Early career faculty, had no timee to learn it himself. But he not only gave us time, hee trusted us to develop and implement standard operating procedures for our team. 

He trusted us, and he did not need to learn it first, because that would have slowed us down, and he didn't have the time.

# A team that works like a team

knitr::include_graphics("img/ohi-team-2018b-crop.jpeg")

we learned to work as a team, which meant trusting and learning from each other. We also thought a lot about what happens when people join and leave our group and how to onboard and offboard them. 

In addition to our lab meetings where we discuss science, we started having separate meetings to talk specifically about data, learn together, and build shared practices

Really critical to our becoming a team was that we created a space to focus on the data. 

transition: so these were the elements of our local research team but the third point is critical as well, which is community. I'm actually going to have to take a few slides to talk about this.

Early on, we were welcomed by the rOpenSci and RStudio communities and were able to meet and work with our heroes at a few conferences nad unconfs. 

It was a big deal to be feel so welcomed here, it made such a difference with our skillsets and confidence. 

I personally was amazed that developers were real people. And not only that, they were super nice people that made me feel welcome and valued even as I was feeling insecure about my coding skills. 

Prior to these communities I had never stopped to think that there were real people behind software.

This was really the defining point in my life. This is was that turning point when I really became the person I am today — that person who never stops talking about the wonders of R and data science and open science and community.

Twitter also played a big role, which is why I'm showing you all of these as tweets. 

I joined Twitter to learn R, because of my colleague Jamie. 

I had never used Twitter before, so I was definitely skeptical. I thought it was a megaphone for angry people, I didn't realize it was a place to have thoughtful conversations with lovely people, and most of all is is a way to listen and learn with others. 

And it's been a really imporant way to connect with so many people, especially RLadies.

#Teamwork

<br>

### supportive leadership 
### research group that works like a team
### online and local communities

???

So that's all to say that teamwork was critical to OHI's success. 

These are these intangibles that scientists don't normally talk about. 

And we didn't spend much time on them in the paper, because we focused on the tools. 

But it's not the tools alone; we need people. 

---
name: ods-teamwork-loop
# open data science <-> teamwork doodle

???

And throughout all of this a main thing I've realized is that data science and teamwork exist together in a feedback loop. 

Learning and using similar software promotes and streamlines teammwork. And also working as a team better equips you to learn data science.

It becomes both team culture and data science tools that streamline how we work and innovate. 

You really need both. Trying to engage solely with open data science without teamwork can be lonely and deflating. And only as a team but without the best collaborative software can be inefficient.

transition: This is a loop that feeds back on itself. For me, and likely for a lot of us in this room, this becomes difficult to differentiate and tease apart.

And it's also what we're talking about here. 

This feedback loop accelerates our science and our quality of life because it makes data analysis more supportive and fun.

But as scientists, we are often unaware of what was possible with open data science, and how it would benefit us and our research, because this is rarely part of our education

---
template: ods-teamwork-loop

???

It took us 4 years to learn how to work as a team and use open data science tools. 

Other research labs shouldn't have to figure this out on their own like we did with OHI, and to be honest, we don't have time to waste. 

So how do we accelerate this and make it so that it isn't such a painful and long process for other labs?

transition: This is what drives Openscapes.  

---
```{r openscapes-hex, out.width = '50%', fig.align='center'}

Openscapes is a mentorship program for research groups. 

I help scientists work like teams and engage in open data science so they can do better science in less time. 

---
# Zoom

???

It is an online mentorship program, with scientists from 7 research groups participating for 5 months. 

Leaders and members from each research group participate, so we have a mix of faculty, lecturers, and program managers, along with graduate students, postdocs, techniciants, and lab managers. 

This can be challenging, but it is deliberate. 

Everyone has different skillsets and responsibilities but it's important for them all to interact so everyone sees the value and power of what's possible.

Leaders, who likely do not have time to learn everything themselves, feels comfortable letting their research groups develop these skillsets, and the lab members have support, agency and paths forward for what to do. 

<!---

SEtup from OHI: Openscapes will be less painful and long for other groups.
What we realized is that both of these end points arentbeing addressed in reaserch labs and how they are connecteed wasn't discussed. So the dev and interconnectedness of both of these. And how it realtes to openscapes. OPENSCAPES IS MAKING THIS WHEEL

that's the big picutre problem. 
Also liked the concrete lessons learned so if I could say these. From case studies: it's a big up front time investment but worth it. 

story idea: Build / structure: keep returning to this loop. The first side we want to focus on is culture and support. until we deal with this ds will be deflating. So for the frist 5 weeks we focused on the culture side of things. Now we transition from open and trusta nd honesty. Then, what are the tools we can use within that to do bsilt. These tools and these communities. We realized this awesome loop exists that adccelerates our science and our quality of life. If that's what Openscapes is based on, keep returning to it. How do these interact with each other. Explain the loop that this creates for labs. How openscapse closes this into a cohesive loop
THose things can't exist separately if you want to succesfful lab, it makes everyone more happy labs operate as teams, makes it more reproducble happier

Openscapes is completely built around helping research groups prioritize teamwork and open data science and engage within the realities of their existing research commitments. 

The first half of the program we focus on teamwork and culture within the research group. 

And after we had established more openness, trust, and honesty, in the second half we transitioned to the open data science tools that enable better science in less time.

Allison has upgraded her stats course and now not only teaches the tidyverse but also GitHub. She also got all of her course materials online and created this website for her students to be able to access everything more easily. 

This means that every year, when nearly 100 students complete their masters degree they join the workforce in government, conservation and other aspects of environmental science and management, and they take these skills with them. 

She has also shared all her courses online and created a website — and something that is awesome is that Michelle who I just mentioned is going to be leading a new course at Rutgers using these lessons herself.

Scientists answering really important questions in environmental science that affect our planet and our way of life, but they don't always have the skills and teams they need.  

And truly, Openscapes is not the long-term solution. Scientists should not be learning this on their own time through pockets of opportunity. 

(something about how we need to teach this!)?

Yes, open data science means powerful tools for data analyis and reproducibility. But also for communiication and collaboration, and it's a whole ethos. 

/// ALSO

Open data science needs to be part of our formal education. 

And working responsibly and collaboratively with data needs to become part of what it means to be a scientist. 

Honestly this need is so great. Working with data isn't yet a true part of our conversations. When I bring it up there is often confusion about what I'm talking about and then it turns into a confessional about their data practices and filenames. So we need to value this more and support scientists.

Team, redefined. Within your official team, or research group, but also across cohorts, with collaborators, with this rstats community. 

We need to value teamwork and 

In addition to focusing on really emotionally challenging topics like species extinction and climate change, there are so many pressures on scientists time, from research, grant writing, mentoring, teaching, and that adds to why it can be so overwhelming to also be tasked with open data science. 

But if we can have science value teamwork and collaboration more, where skillsets overlap and are valued rather than everyone feeling like they have to do it all, we will be better off.

So this means trust and time

# make welcome a part of everything
<!---power of welcome OR Weave welcome throughout everything you do OR --->

???

The power of welcome is real. I learned this early from the folks at rOpenSci and RStudio with their commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive space. 

Having empathy and accepting/internalizing that people who are doing amazing env science might be really intimidated by data science and they might need to be welcomed. 
transition: so these are the main lessons learned: the need for open data science, the need for teamwork, and the power of welcome.

And the awesome thing is that we all have our part. 

Throughout all my experiences with squid, ohi, and openscapes, a critical thing is that anyone can step up and be a leader. 

And the easiest/fastest way is to welcome and encourage others with open data science and teamwork.

And if you yourself are unsure you have a team or feel like you're on the outside of the feedback loop or on the threshold, know that since you're here so you're already part of it.

challenges ops?

biggest challenges:
- labs dont think like teams
- pis feel they should leearn first

big ops
- talk to colleagues

comes back to making this more visiblee so can be more valued

how do you set up good practices for the lab when you do not know those practices yourself? And if you don't have time to learn, and they're always changing? 
- I feel it. Need help with databases. 


Obstacles
And there are obstacles, the primary being time, especially when this investmentis not evaluated or rewarded broadly in the academic structure in regards to promotion and job security. 

And there are opps but challenges as teams. how do you lead well when you dont know?

I want to end by saying thank you to this community for so many things, but particurly to its leadership in creating a diverse and inclusive space. I have learned so much about the importance of diverse and inclusive spaces, and this is an area that I in particular want to help extend these aspects of our culture to the environmental science community, and well beyond. 

Thank you.

Our #rstats community is so amazing. 

It is welcoming, it is inclusive, it is supportive, it is empowering. 

There is such a mix of people from diverse backgrounds and experiences, from all over the world, online and in person, innovating and learning together. 

What's different about our community is that we put people first and are really here to share ideas and learn together. 

We are all here because we have been empowered by R as a tool and a community, but we can all probably think of others that are still feeling stranded and alone. We might work with them day-to-day.

# data_analysis_v2.xls
data_12_11_12.R
re:fwd:final data updated

???

Our story starts off here, in 2013. 

I know this looks painful but we had been doing data processing in whatever way we had all learned on our own previously. Most was in excel and a bit in R, with decisions documented in accompanying Word documents and emails. 

So then the year I started when we went to repeat the analysis, there was a lot of forensics and detective work to uncover what we had even done the first time, much less figuring out how to repeat it. 

*[What strikes me about this now is that these ways we had all been working had gotten us far, our team had PhDs and masters degrees and are now working at a really prestigious center. So these homegrown ways got us far for a little while as individuals, but they did not work as a team. ]*

Needless to say, we needed a better system. So here is what we do now. And again, this was over a four-year period, and we continue to iterate and improve.

# Actually being reproducible 

TOO much GitHub (esp with IT.)
Instead, show a few examples of ways that we use to use R for comm. 
NO BULLETS.
that we can generate for each country. 
Maybe just the word "simple RMd websites"

Work on no "and" transistions with bullets.
We had a boss even thought they weren't using R, gave us space. 
Maybe numbers are less tedius "next", "second"

Slide where I say "Box 1 and Box 2". if you don't expect people to read it, dont put it here. There's a of info here b ut whe I want you to know
Box 1 is relataed to ds skills and workflow and Box 2 is the culture and comm
OTHERWISE DON"T PUT THEM IN THERE.
if you want people to realize NSSD> it then you have to point it out
Some of our resources are the NSSD podcasts and nontraditional resources for building our skills and community. 

Maybe just include part of [Table 1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160/tables/1)? 

(maybe bullet this, and animate?)

# original porrige ramble

All of this has had me thinking about how software enables teamwork and teamwork enables software. I'm going to try talking about this here; I have trouble articulating it but think it is really critical for moving forward. 

So thinking about it from the software side, there is software that is designed to streamline teamwork. So for example, Google Docs lets you co-edit and therefore co-think together in real time. GitHub helps you collaborate with others. And there are also things like the tidyverse that help create shared social norms that make it easier to work as a team. 

On the other side, if you are on a team or community you might have more courage to engage in new software; RLadies chapters, meetup groups, #tidytuesday

So for a lot of us in this room, this turns into a feedback loop and get almost difficult to differentiate and tease apart. so it might be less of a loop but more like a porridge...

And OHI is an example where one person with knowledge of the software enabled the team to engage, which meant more of us were using the software, which then strengthened the team norms and culture. 

And eco-data-science starts at the other side maybe, where it was a group of friends asking one person with knowledge of R how to learn, so it went from the team to the software and then 

But the reason I'm thinking about this is because of entry points. What if you are outside of this loop. You might use software, but not really with any collaboration or teamwork in mind. Maybe you don't even feel like you're part of a team. 

How do you engage and welcome people in those cases? 

transition: thinking about this was a big part of how I designed Openscapes. Really wanted to focus on how software can streamline teamwork and teams can learn how to use software.

Data science and teamwork have incredible potential accelerate scientific research. They can help uncover solutions to our most pressing problems, which in the environmental space where I work include food security and sustainable resource use on land and in the oceans.

# We lack a supportive scientific culture and opportunities to learn

???

We lack opportunities to learn data science and we lack a scientific culture that supports us to incorporate it into our research. 

My experience, and the experience of my other lab members, is typical. And not just for marine biologists, but for ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and all sister domains that can fit into environmental science. 

It is not even a part of our culture to talk about data practices, which makes teamwork and collaboration more difficult since we do not have the mindset or really even the vocabulary to do so.
