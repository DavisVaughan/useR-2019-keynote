I am a marine ecologist, and #rstats has been game-changing for my science and my life.

I am a marine ecologist, and #rstats has been game-changing for my science and my life. I'm going to tell you a bit about my story and my path and how we can all change science << keep this super clean/polished as opening statement

pic montage of me with squid, and with tags

???

For my PhD I was interested in climate change effects on marine ecosystems and particularly on species that have effects on humans through fisheries. I studied the behavior and ecology of squid super awesome squid. 
The first 2 years of my PhD was taking classes, TAing a subtidal ecology course, scuba diving, learning all I could about oceanography, squid behavior and ecology, fisheries, invasive species. Meeting other scientists, trying to figure out what it meant to be a scientist. 
I was putting together my dissertation question, finally going out to collect my data
And there, in my hand, I'm hold data. Amazing. where it went, habitat conditions, etc. 

<!---
But I pretty quickly lost that enthusiasm: the data were big data to me: too big for excel. The only tool I knew. it was the worst. << This should be included to bridge gap to next section!!!! Your personal conflict is important!

Environmental scientists are doing really critical and amazing work. Solving these problems. << Remember to cut words always

R4DS fig minus hadley

???

And the training we get is really focused around the domain and communication. They are really comfortable in the science and in the communication parts. They are literally coming back from fieldwork aroudn the world to testify before congress etc. 
But there is a huge missing piece:

R4DS complete


???

But there is this huge missing piece that is data science. And not only the tools, but the mindset and culture that comes with those tools. 

I like to talk about this in terms of analogies with Star Wars. 
<!---
But they are unsupported in the data science. They are never taught computing, never taught data science. We could be so much more effective if we knew that #rstats exists and that it is a welcoming place

demoralizing, lonely <<Careful saying "scientists" generally w/o qualifier

<<Question to transition here. What *can* this feel like instead? 

Yoda

???
ODS, Yoda's a mentor, and Luke can learn

---
Rey

???
In this analogy too people can quickly become mentors to others. <<careful here, Luke was a shitty mentor

---
Hands

???
But also a super important part is that it's not just about the tools (Force) and the people that know them (Jedis). It's about the whole movement, and the many ways to contribute, and the bigger picture of what's going on. <<Work on transition!

(animate Stef value of welcome, buzzfeed datacamp)

???

And that's what I feel #rstats has been doing. 
These are some of the communities that have been for influential for me. Because of the tools and the people behind them and the examples they set. 

And this community has been so welcoming and supportive, standing up for each other. 

I am so lucky to be a part of this community. As a scientist, there are not a ton of pathways there, I am lucky to have been introduced to RStudio as they were developing dplyr and knitr. I'm lucky to have met Karthik and then Hadley and Jenny.
We found this on our own, had to seek it out. No one told us. Not a thing that is in the culture of science. 

<!---These #rstats communities have been so important for me as a scientist, and
Turned the tide. It is because of people like Hadley and Karthik and Jenny who were real people, nice people, who welcomed us in 

We protect our own. Datacamp. This matters. Thank you for everyone involved directly and in supporting and enabling roles. We are all here to learn from, with, and for each other.

open software -> open mindset & culture -> (looped) as a tiny image above R4DS complete fig

<!---what if science felt more like rstats? text --->
???

So I've been thinking about what if science felt more like rstats? What is we could bring this welcoming, supportive culture to science?

 and help individuals and help the culture as a whole? 

I've been thinking a lot about having confidence with software leads to a more open and confident community. And how it's been this missing piece for scientists. What makes this happen is an investment in people and culture and community. 

(as opposed to how not having confidence in software leads to homegrown methods -> guarded mindset, shame, --> difficult to share ideas and admit what we don't know --> to learn from each other

transition:: what would it look like?
