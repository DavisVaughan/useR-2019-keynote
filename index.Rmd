<!---KEEP IN MIND

Environmental scientist doing research. "How can we bring this to science" is way too big
When I say science = = "bring #rstats to science" what does that mean
"when I say bring to science the level I'm talking about is here" 

--->

Sq: small to my size, eat a lot, expanding range, why? How? Holding data, don't know responsible. I made it through with the help of a few mentors who helped Matlab, and while I'm proud of my work, I'm not proud of my code. It was a painful time in my life. And like most environmental scientists. Un specied feel like this. 

I like to talk about this with star wars. 

Luke demoralized. If we imagine for a moment that he went ahead and took this on by himself, you could imigine it wouldn't be very pretty, it would take a long time, not reproducible. he wouldn't be very proud of ti. But he would eventually get his plane flying again, and he could be proud of that, but he wouldn't want to tell people how he'd done it. And he'd be limited by how much he could contribute by the time he got back to the game. 

To bring this back to science, that is how it feels like — stranded with data. (would it be funny to have arrows that say environmental scientists, data" and "#rstats)

Yoda: he has a skillset that can solve luke's problem never imagined. Luke can learn and will go on to solve this problem, but in less time and he's able to show up at the right time. And then, it will open his mind to what is possible and the challenges he can take on. 

This is what rstats and more broadly open data science, feels like. It is so powerful for science and the skills and tools are so critical. 

But also, something that is critical here is that it's not just about the tools and the people who know how to use them. It's not just about jedis and the force. it's about a whole diversity of people. 

This is us. This is #rstats. 

rstats culture

[where does r4ds drwaing fit in? here?]

I've been thinking a lot about how we can welcome more people to r and rstats community, but also how we can extend this culture to other communities. I work in marine science and environmental sci more broadly, but this applies much more broadly than that. We are all parts of different communities and we are all passionate about rstats, we can become leaders. 

I'll share an example of what it can look like for a team to essentially start from scratch and become a visible example of impact. And I'll share about how to try to replicate this with other teams. Throughout I will emphasize how this is not unique to env science, or science. It's about leadership from all sides, teamwork, and about using r for communication and culture

I am a marine ecologist, and #rstats has been game-changing for my science and my life.

I am a marine ecologist, and #rstats has been game-changing for my science and my life. I'm going to tell you a bit about my story and my path and how we can all change science << keep this super clean/polished as opening statement

pic montage of me with squid, and with tags

???

For my PhD I was interested in climate change effects on marine ecosystems and particularly on species that have effects on humans through fisheries. I studied the behavior and ecology of squid super awesome squid. 
The first 2 years of my PhD was taking classes, TAing a subtidal ecology course, scuba diving, learning all I could about oceanography, squid behavior and ecology, fisheries, invasive species. Meeting other scientists, trying to figure out what it meant to be a scientist. 
I was putting together my dissertation question, finally going out to collect my data
And there, in my hand, I'm hold data. Amazing. where it went, habitat conditions, etc. 


But I pretty quickly realized how that I was literally holding this data in my hand but not trained to responsibly use it. I did learn how to code but I think it was the wrong way: it was a struggle, by myself, alone, and just to get the job done. 

Transition: But  that's something I see across the board. They are doing awesome things

Environmental scientists are doing really critical and amazing work. Solving these problems.  << Remember to cut words always

They are trained to do their science and get policy changed. 

They are trained in domain and comms but there is this huge missing piece.

And the training we get is really focused around the domain and communication. They are really comfortable in the science and in the communication parts. They are literally coming back from fieldwork aroudn the world to testify before congress etc. 
But there is a huge missing piece: 

transition:

R4DS complete

???

But there is this huge missing piece that is data science. And not only the tools, but the mindset and culture that comes with those tools. 

Data science, coding, or any kind of computing is not usually a part of our education. Working with data is an integral part of science, and how well you do it can be an integral part of your scientific experience and success. But we largely have to learn on our own. There are few courses to teach data analysis within environmental science departments, so most of us learn inefficiently: by ourselves, in a panic, and alone.  [[[Really emphasize & let sink in that we are never given computing and analysis training. ]]]

transition: I like to talk about this in terms of analogies with Star Wars.

Luke

???

demoralizing, lonely <<Careful saying "scientists" generally w/o qualifier

try to imagine how he'd feel. not reproducible, not proud of it. 
But we're still professionals. Let's rewrite star wars for a little bit. It wouldn't want to share. But ultimately he'd have an xwing in the sky. He'd still go an defeat the the death star but he wouldn't ell anyone how he'd done it. 

(say, don't break visually) So just going back to science. I'm not saying people don't do great science. But we don't get to see inside their cupboard. They are nervous to share how they got there. In terms of their code. They share their scientific methods. 
<We're not alone. This is the whole cohort>

Don't do it for BSILT. because it's a pretty thing. What if people took pride in their beautiful neat code and wanted to share it? You just do it bc it's impressive

Messy code and neat code slide?

transition: But what *can* this feel like instead?

Yoda

My point is that yoda comes along and shows the force and it's more elegant and beautiful
He wouldn't have had the guidance to turn off the auto-guidance system. 
???
ODS, Yoda, and Luke can learn
and then you can become the mentor
this doesn't come individually, this comes from supportive environments.

ODS is this celebratory thing. 
But if he had had to use levers and pullies, he would have put that all in a cupboard.

But also a super important part is that it's not just about the tools (Force) and the people that know them (Jedis).

It's about the whole movement. It's about working together with people from different backgrounds and skillsets and having many ways to contribute. 

Going back to science = environmental science doesn't feel like this to me right now. We're not a team, we are fragmented. But this is us. This is #rstats, this is ODS

This has motivated so much of my work. Because although there are tools like the Force, and althrough there are communities like our rebel alliance, this is not in the culture of env science. We are all still stranded at the swamp like luke; we are struggling alone without knowing there are better ways. 

transition: And this is not just in Star Wars, this is us —

Our #rstats community is this mix of people from diverse backgrounds and experiences, innovating and learning together, and really doing so much more together. 

What's different about our #rstats community is that we put people first. We've put a big emphasis on communication and culture

Transition: We are focused on a positive experience where we support each other.

# #rstats culture

## welcoming, inclusive, supportive, & innovative

???

Welcome each other and stand up for each other. This creates a positive space for us to teach each other, learn together, and innovate together. And because of it, we are stronger. We are better innovators. 

This has been so impactful for me as a scientist, to feel so welcomed, included, and supported.
Because of the people here in this room and the examples they have set, both in R and around R. It has totally changed the way I do science and the way I think about what is possible. 

I am so lucky to be a part of this community. It has empowered me and helped me build confidence that translates well beyond code. It has made me feel part of a bigger movement.

And I think for a lot of us, we are so lucky to have #rstats community but it is not necessarily the way our day-to-day communities that we work with operate. 


transition: How do we extend the #rstats culture to our other communities?

# How do we extend the #rstats culture?

???

How can we become leaders in our own spaces/domains and help bring these values and collaborative, innovative spirit? I think about this a lot in env science, and I want to share some strategies that we can try in other science domains and outside of science too. 


transition: for environmental scientists, there are still not a lot of pathways here. And the culture as a whole does not feel like this — we do not put our values forward, we do not think of people and community. 

---
R4DS total figure, reprise

???

For many environmental scientists, this is still not the reality, the data science bit is missing.

How do we make this part of the norm? 

From my own experience and having spent the last 6 years leading programs, one strategy is  about creating strong teams within science that can be examples for others, and champions for these practices. Once Luke saw what was possible for Yoda to do, he gained confidence that he could do  it and he was willing to put the time into learning. 

If we can do that in science — if we can show what is possible and have people see themselves in that narrative, they will have confidence that this is a good way forward. If they value it and not only want to put in the time to learn on their own, but will help champion it for others and help this become part of the curriculum for what it means to be an environmental scientist. 

it's not tools, it's mindset. It's about seeing what's possible and being welcomed in. And I've been thinking about it not only from the data analysis and data science side, which is huge. 

transition: But in terms of welcoming environmental scientists, I've been thinking about it from the communication and culture side as well.

R for science communication and culture

R has not only changed my analytical life, it's changed what's possible with science communication as well. and I think it can also change scientific culture; we can replicate/bring/remix what we have here in the #rstats community to environmental science, so that we put people first and can tackle these environmental issues. 

I'm going to tell you about an example of each: what's possible for env science and also for culture

nature paper screenshot

???

In a 2017 paper I led with my team, trying to be an example of what this can look like in science. 
we described how ODS helped us do better science in less time, how over the course of 4 years we incrementally introduced #rstats and github into our workflows and how it impacted the work we do and who uses it. And we identified 2 barriers: exposure and confidence. 

rstats is still not part of the culture of environmental science, so the 
There is a lack of exposure to what is possible, and a lack of confidence 

As a scientist, there are not a ton of pathways there, 

We found this on our own, had to seek it out. No one told us. Not a thing that is in the culture of science. 

transition: but what if it could be? so I want to give a two examples: what could this look like in environmental science? and how can we help welcome more scientists in?

---
# what does #rstats ethos look like in environmental science?

# how can we welcome others?  what if science prioritized community?

What's cool is that it opens up what communication can mean for science. It can make it more interactive, quicker. Science communication can mean publishing a peer-reviewed paper, it can mean talking with a journalist. It can mean tweeting, giving talks, etc. But now, with R, it can mean publishing books. It can mean

how can we bring this welcoming and supportive culture to researchers in environmental science specifically who have such inmportant questions to answer but don't have the skillsets


I've been thinking a lot about having confidence with software leads to a more open and confident community. And how it's been this missing piece for scientists. What makes this happen is an investment in people and culture and community.

How do we motivate others?

Talk about and show your colleagues how R makes you 

- a data scientist

but also 

- an author
- a web designer
- a designer
- a community member
- a leader

Say this to your colleagues: R makes me xyz
