# Today's goals

Showcase good practices for beginning and seasoned R users alike.  

Take some time to reflect on how we code or aspire to code: code for ourselves, our future selves, and others.

- i'm marine ecol, which means enviro sci, best community
- software, best, like you
- open, moz best
- bridging all. OHI. And now Openscapes:: because env. sci: luke, yoda. *more powerful than we ever imagined. opened our minds*

but first about OHI, how we work
but first describe team, because we seem bigger than we are, and we are more skilled than we were 6 years ago. actually diff responsibilities. more like a lab than a software company 
  - think: how is this like your group, diff 
  
our team circa episode IV. 
- yoda: bb
- us: leia, luke, han. 
- ben: r2d2. 
  
How R helped us get there. Not just the actual tools, but also enabled this mindset.   
- went form forwareded excel sheets to Rmd data prep. share all. 
- 


So waht do we teach in openscapes

- seaside chags
-hackathons
-study groups
-cocs. deliberateness. planning together. google docs. 
- also rmd, tidyverse. rOpensci

Take homes from these 3 communities: 
- work like a team, and a movement

-ropensci good for bridging env sci with software

-think of your lab like a team, 


Also incorp:
- reduce friction
- squid?
