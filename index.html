KEEP IN MIND

Environmental scientist doing research. "How can we bring this to science" is way too big
When I say science = = "bring #rstats to science" what does that mean
"when I say bring to science the level I'm talking about is here" 


TOO MANY WORDS&gt; the most important things get lost if each is a full paragraph

each slide is 2-3 sentences. percision of speech. every word should be throughful and precise. to create emphasis of tihngs


instead of saying "i've been thinking a lot about" "the question I ask: how can we bring this ethos to env sci". That's been guiding my efforts

add one sentence: environmental problems are critical. what a bummer what they don't 

R has changed my life, and so much that now I'm actively working to have it to change the lives of more scientists like me.

Next time: stand up and present!
SUMMARIZE AS A HEADER
people love feeling they're smart and they love feeling they're making progress (so get off the title slides)

Q's for Allison: 

- aaaaaah I love the R4DS drawing!!!
- first slides, I need to pick, what should it be: 
  - R and data science
  - data science and open practices
  - open data science
  - open/data science (read as 'open data science')
  
- add Star Wars at the beginning? 
- and Luke in the center of the R4DS?

- repeat story arc: trouble, r can help! repeat (2 more times if do star wars). Maybe I take out the sad face and the "to be clear". 

- Also: can you send me an invoice. 2K
---&gt;

## R and data science have incredible potential accelerate scientific research.

???

NO UM START What's my starting word? WELL or SO

Well thank you so much, it is so amazing to be here with all of you and I want to thank the organizers for this invitation. 

R and data science have incredible potential accelerate scientific research. They can help uncover solutions to our most pressing problems, which in the environmental space where I work include food security and sustainable resource use on land and in the oceans.  

---
## R and data science have incredible potential accelerate scientific research.

## But many environmental scientists are being excluded from this potential.

But many environmental scientists are being excluded from this potential. 

---
## R and data science have incredible potential accelerate scientific research.

## But many environmental scientists are being excluded from this potential.  

## We lack opportunities to learn and we lack a supportive scientific culture.

???

We lack opportunities to learn data science and we lack a scientific culture that supports us to incorporate it into our research. 

We are not taught, incentivized, evaluated, or rewarded. &lt;&lt;--necessary?

We simply to not value data science and open practices. &lt;&lt;--necessary? 

It is not even a part of our current culture to talk about data practices, and so as individuals we do not even have the mindset or even the vocabulary to do so. 

We also do not see examples of its benefits in our own context, and we do not see welcoming entry points to engage. 

transition:: But I know that we can change this culture in environmental science, and in other scientific fields as well.
---
# But #rstats can help

???

And we can do it following the example of our #rstats community here. 

I know this is possible because I have lived through this mindset change myself, and I have spent the last 6 years igniting cultural change in environmental science by working with colleagues around the world. 

&gt;&gt;&gt; I think star wars goes here::: We are scientists that are passionate about our work, and well-trained in our domains of ecology, physiology, biology, genomics. But we pretty immediately feel overwhelmed when it comes to data. I like to talk about this in terms of analogies with Star Wars. This is Luke. But Yoda can help. And most importantly, it's about community. 

transition: So we'll come back to star Wars, but now let's come back to this planet and talk about what it's like to be an environmental scientist.

r4ds minus hadley — environmental side. 

(how interdisc and public good)

???

Environmental scientists have a lot in common with the open source community because we are working for the public good, and passionate about our work. 

Environmental science is actually not a distinct discipline, but a collective term used to describe biologists, ecologists, physiologists, and genetecists and even economists working at the interface of environment, ecology, and people.

We are deeply interdisciplinary, because our research questions require us to become experts in the many different domains we work in. For example, a ecologist studying how pollinators affect agriculture crops might also need to understand the biology, behavior, and genomics of different bee populations along with local and regional patterns of rain, snowmelt, and drought. 

&lt;!---And for my PhD work I had to learn about oceanography, fisheries, squid biology and ecology in the coastal Pacific Ocean.---&gt;

---
r4ds minus hadley — environmental + communications

???

And our resulting findings are really impactful for society. Our findings help understand food systems, disease transmission, and climate change. And this means that communicating and collaborating with many different people is critical. We are often working with government bodies at local and international scales to help inform change on the ground.

So we work in different domains but something that unifies us is that we collect and work with a lot of data. 

transition: To be able to analyze our data, most of us do end up coding to some degree. But we have to learn on our own, and it's intimidating. We resist it as long as we can before scrambling to learn just enough to get the job done at the last moment, usually in a total panic. 

And this means we're not really proud of our code, which means we are less inclined to talk about it, and resistant to sharing it. And this perpetuates the culture of not talking about data and coding, and therefore not valuing it. 
 

&lt;!---
r4ds minus hadley — environmental + communications with big sad face in the middle

???

But since we are rarely formally taught to code or work responsibly with data, learning to code is an individual, isolating struggle. — we feel like Luke Skywalker did.

We are all struggling alone and somehow we all think that we are the only one who are struggling or that we are the only ones who don't know how to code, so we don't talk about it. 

There's this mindset that figuring out how to analyze data on your own is part of the scientific discovery process. 

Like, that formatting dates is part of ecology. These dates are part of your science, and cannot be abstracted. 

There is not necessarily even an expectation that someone in the world has had to deal with dates before, because these aren't just any dates, these are special dates about your bees at your study site. 

But this mindset means that coding is a really intimidating thing to learn on our own. We resist it as long as we can before scrambling to learn just enough to get the job done at the last moment, usually in a total panic. 

And this means we're not really proud of our code, which means we are less inclined to talk about it, and resistant to sharing it. And this perpetuates the culture of not talking about data and coding, and therefore not valuing it.

# To be very clear

???

I want to be really clear that I am not trying to disparage environmental scientists. 

--

- Environmental scientists are doing good work that is important &amp; impactful

???

We are doing really important, impactful work. And this work is on challenging, complex systems that are changing rapidly. 

--

- Some do value data science &amp; open practices 

???

Also, I know there are many examples of environmental scientists who do value data science and open practices — there are many in this room. 

--
- But broadly, we are not learning skills to work responsibly with data

???

But, we need to be honest that on the whole, we are not being formally taught the fundamental skills we need to work responsibly with data. Our culture in environmental science does not value data science and open practices, and at a time when we do not have any time to waste. 

transition: And I am convinced that R can help here. 
---&gt;

---
# r4ds complete 

???

But R as a tool and a community can really benefit environmental science. 

R streamlines how we work with data, and also streamlines how we work with each other. 

&lt;!---the language itself allows for that, but then additionally---&gt;
And the R community has really focused on creating a positive space for people like me to be welcomed as human beings first, and encouraged and supported as coders.

This makes the R community such a powerful and positive place for innovation and collaboration, and I think this is exactlly what environmental science needs.

So with I want to do is not only welcome more environmental scientists to the R community, I want to simultaneously extend our values and our ethos to environmental science.


&gt;&gt;&gt; new slide: to be clear: 

transition: So over the past year with my Mozilla Fellowship, I've been trying to do this through a program I've developed called Openscapes.

---
# (outline slide)
.pull-right[Openscapes hex

- mentorship program for research groups
- create more visible examples &amp; champions for open data science
- just completed pilot cohort!
]
???

With Openscapes I'm focusing on building this culture at the core community unit of science, the research group or laboratory. 

Openscapes is a mentorship program for research groups, helping them engage with open data science and become visible examples and vocal champions for open data science within their broader communities. 

We've just completed the pilot cohort of this mentoring program with 7 research groups, and I'm excited to tell you all about it bc I am so proud of what they accomplished.

--
.pull-left[OHI hex

- example of open data science in action

]

???

But to tell the Openscapes story I need to first tell the Ocean Health Index story. It's because I designed the Openscapes program based on the struggles and wins our own team experienced.

ADDDDD to end of OHI section:::What we learened from the OHI process is that anyone on our team can be a leader. DOn't sell this punchline right upfront.
We can all be leaders
So this is what I will focus on for the rest of the talk.

Probably the biggest takehome message is about how we can all be leaders in welcoming others into R and extending the R community.



&lt;!---

--

???


We are all parts of different communities and we are all passionate about rstats, we can become leaders. I'll share an example of what it can look like for a team to essentially start from scratch and become a visible example of impact. And I'll share about how to try to replicate this with other teams. Throughout I will emphasize how this is not unique to env science, or science. It's about leadership from all sides, teamwork, and about using r for communication and culture
---&gt;

---
OHI hex, bigger centered

???

The first example is the Ocean Health Index.

There is a lot to say about OHI but I want to focus on how R enabled a culture change within our team and more broadly. 

R made it easier not only easier to do analyses better, but now we are building websites and books and can communicate better with each other and more broadly with collaborators, partners, stakeholders — something that has been limiting in science when you're otherwise limited forwarding PDFs to each other. 

And there is no way that we could have so much reach and impact without #rstats and the ODS community.

---
OHI measure illustration
Q for Allison:: I would love to show the team early instead of at the end, not sure it works early though.

???

The ocean health index is a project to measure what we value about our oceans using the best available data and science. 

It is a really ambitious project. 

One of the big things we do is we score how healthy oceans are for every coastal country around the world using the best science and nearly 100 publically available data sets, and we repeat this process annually to track change through time. 

So we set out to be the best approach for data-driven marine policy around the world, and indeed now it is used by the United Nations and also by twenty government and university groups. 

transition: We did NOT set out to be the best approach for what open data science could look like in environmental science —

---
# nature paper (authors only no abstract)

&lt;!---
if include read it, but probably don't include.
We are among the many environmental scientists who were never formally trained to work deliberately with data. Thus, we were unaware of how significantly open data science tools could directly benefit our research11,73, and upon learning about them we were hesitant, or even resistant, to engage. However, we were able to develop confidence in large part because of the open, inclusive and encouraging online developer community that builds tools and creates tutorials that meet scientists where they are
---&gt;

???

But when we realized that we had an important story to tell, sharing our path to better science in less time in 2017 really resonated with a lot of people. 

This paper is a retrospective of how we incrementally introduced R and GitHub into our workflow over a period of four years.

--
How R &amp; and GitHub helped change the culture of our science, because it made reproducibility, collaboration, and communication much easier to do. 

???
How R &amp; and GitHub helped change the culture of our science, because it made reproducibility, collaboration, and communication much easier to do. 

It lays out how in particular the tidyverse, RMarkdown, shiny helped change the culture of our science, because it made reproducibility, collaboration, and communication much easier to do. 

I won't go through all of this here but I want to give some highlights, and particularly focus on how R and GitHub really redefined what communication means for us in science. 

Being able to efficiently share and communicate our work while it is ongoing rather than only post-publication has been really critical for us bridging science and policy.

# Figure 1

???

This is an illustration from the paper conveying how much less time it took... 

This illustration is trying to convey how repeating our work each year takes less time, and got easier on the collaboration and reproducibility fronts. This has freed up our time to work on improving documentation and training, along with improving the science as better data and methods were available. 

I joined the team in 2013, the first year we were going to recalculate scores with an additional year of data. And this 2013 circle is not as small as you would imagine it would be if repeating our work from the previous year involved hitting go on a bunch of scripts. 

transition: And that's because in 2013 we were working the way we always had as marine ecologists — and we thought we were being reproducible.

---
# We thought we were being reproducible 

data_analysis_v2.xls
data_12_11_12.R
re:fwd:final data updated

???

We worked with hand-versioned excel files or R scripts we would email to each other. 

I know this looks painful but we had been doing data processing in whatever way we had all learned on our own previously. Most was in excel and a bit in R, with decisions documented in accompanying Word documents and emails. 

So then the year I started when we went to repeat the analysis, there was a lot of forensics and detective work to uncover what we had even done the first time, much less figuring out how to repeat it. 

*[What strikes me about this now is that these ways we had all been working had gotten us far, our team had PhDs and masters degrees and are now working at a really prestigious center. So these homegrown ways got us far for a little while as individuals, but they did not work as a team. ]*

Needless to say, we needed a better system. So here is what we do now. And again, this was over a four-year period, and we continue to iterate and improve.

# Actually being reproducible 

TOO much GitHub (esp with IT.)
Instead, show a few examples of ways that we use to use R for comm. 
NO BULLETS.
that we can generate for each country. 
Maybe just the word "simple RMd websites"

Work on no "and" transistions with bullets.
We had a boss even thought they weren't using R, gave us space. 
Maybe numbers are less tedius "next", "second"

Slide where I say "Box 1 and Box 2". if you don't expect people to read it, dont put it here. There's a of info here b ut whe I want you to know
Box 1 is relataed to ds skills and workflow and Box 2 is the culture and comm
OTHERWISE DON"T PUT THEM IN THERE.
if you want people to realize NSSD&gt; it then you have to point it out
Some of our resources are the NSSD podcasts and nontraditional resources for building our skills and community. 

Maybe just include part of [Table 1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160/tables/1)? 

(maybe bullet this, and animate?)

.pull-left[
GitHub norms

- create a GitHub organization, admin privileges
  - everyone makes an account, including non-coding team members
- private "issues" repo for discussing methods
  - institutional memory, onboarding &amp; offboarding
- use RStudio &amp; GitHub (version control)
]

.pull-right[R norms

- all data prep, models, viz in R
- coding norms: `tidyverse` &amp; friends
- separate core functions into R package `ohicore`
- separate local "tailorable" models into separate repos 
- data prep narratives in R Markdown
]

???
So now we have a team workflow that I think of is a simplified GitHub workflow. We have a GH org and everyone has an account, and everyone has admin privileges.

- assessment websites (simple RMarkdown)
- documentation (RMarkdown)
- training books (bookdown)
- shiny apps
]

---
ohi-science.org

???

we also created a website with R and friends for our Ocean Health Index community so that we could get beyond forwarding PDFs and writing individual emails. 

The home page is with Jekyll

transition: we also generate simple RMarkdown websites for each as well: ohi-global 

---
ohi-global website

???

These simple RMarkdown websites have been SO valuable for us. We can auto-generate them for any country, we probably have 30 of them that we've made.

---
# OHI Cornwall
ohirepos::deploy_website(repo_registry, push = TRUE) 

???

Here's another example

---
toolbox-training

???
to teach people how to use our software, we've been working on a book

---
data-science-training

???

and we also realized we needed to teach groups how to work with #rstats and Github like we do.

---
ohi-northeast dashboard

???
We are also using shiny in a few ways, but I think this is one of the coolest. 

We are leading OHI Northeast, and it is actually included in part of President Obama's ocean plan. 

The code is based from XXX's, who we saw present at RStudio::conf 2018. 

---
# Issues
Screenshots from Openscapes slides =  aweomsone OHI stuff, 
tweets

---
# Box 1 &amp; 2

???

In the paper we also share resources for what helped us learn, 

--

and recommendataions for how to get started. 

---
# Team culture
OHI photos (shiny, more recent)
(animate and circle BB, BH)

???

Throughout all of this, iteratively, we have become a streamlined team. We have Standard Operating Procedures, and plans for onboardiung and offboarding teammembers, including graduate student fellows that we now train and they repeat the assessment each year. 

And some of the qualities of our team are really important to note, for what made this successful

- someone really jazzed about #rstats (Ben Best)
- a boss/project lead who valued it &amp; gave us space to learn (Ben Halpern)
- welcoming people from the #rstats community (Karthik Ram, Hadley Wickham, Joe Cheng)
- trust &amp; willingness to learn together
- complementary/overlapping skillsets (not everyone codes)

---
# Nature paper reprise

???

So sharing this I think is helping increase the visibility of how open data science can be game-changing.  

Like I said, OHI is used by 20 groups around the world, and will be included in the UN's ocean indicators for the Sustainable Development Goals. 

And it has also been influential in the environmental science ommunity more gbrodly. 

But it does not fully hit the mark for inspiring people to engage. I've gotten feedback that it still feels unachievable to people and excludes people who don't feel like they were part of a team. 

WHAT WE LEARNED FROM THIS PROCESS IS THAT EVERYONE CAN BE A LEADER


&lt;!---

???

Finally, I have to talk about our team. 

We were able to do all of this not only because of the tools, but because of the people involved. 


(maybe just the center/hadley culture part of R4DS illustration?)

???

And I need to talk about our communities

rOpenSci, RStudio, Carpentries, Twitter. 

- Carpentries instructor 
- Eco-Data-Science
- RLadiesSB

# software &lt;-&gt; teamwork 
(spiral? porridge?)

SO LONG. Break it up? Or illustration?
I think of software and teamwork as impacting each other?
Is it a spriral or it porrige, or a loop? FEEDBACK LOOP

A main takeaway taht we learned through OHI
Softwar and teamwork exist togethe in a feedbazck loop. 
learngin similar softwar promotes peammwork. But also working as a team better equips to learn new software. 

But what if you are currently standing outside of this loop? What are the entryways to get into it?
That's openscapes.
in openscapes, 2 things
1. how software can streamline teammwork and 
2. teams learn to use softwear (feedbak loop)
2. how does doing that
feel like a team
visibility of open practices

i'm focuing on the lab and we'll talk about the visibility of the open practices

1 if this cool feedback loop that we've found successful doesn't exist, how do you caret it 
2 and if someone is outside ofit, how do you welcome them


AND HOW DO YOU BECOME A CHAMPION FOR THIS, EVEN IF YOU"RE NOT AN EXPERT?

1. Feedback loop: drwaing
2. That's a big part of openscapes bc wanted to streamline softare and teamwork. 

???

All of this has had me thinking about how software enables teamwork and teamwork enables software. I'm going to try talking about this here; I have trouble articulating it but think it is really critical for moving forward. 

So thinking about it from the software side, there is software that is designed to streamline teamwork. So for example, Google Docs lets you co-edit and therefore co-think together in real time. GitHub helps you collaborate with others. And there are also things like the tidyverse that help create shared social norms that make it easier to work as a team. 

On the other side, if you are on a team or community you might have more courage to engage in new software; RLadies chapters, meetup groups, #tidytuesday

So for a lot of us in this room, this turns into a feedback loop and get almost difficult to differentiate and tease apart. so it might be less of a loop but more like a porridge...

And OHI is an example where one person with knowledge of the software enabled the team to engage, which meant more of us were using the software, which then strengthened the team norms and culture. 

And eco-data-science starts at the other side maybe, where it was a group of friends asking one person with knowledge of R how to learn, so it went from the team to the software and then 

But the reason I'm thinking about this is because of entry points. What if you are outside of this loop. You might use software, but not really with any collaboration or teamwork in mind. Maybe you don't even feel like you're part of a team. 

How do you engage and welcome people in those cases? 

transition: thinking about this was a big part of how I designed Openscapes. Really wanted to focus on how software can streamline teamwork and teams can learn how to use software.


---
# Openscapes hex, center

???

So how do you help people feel like they're part of a team, and increase the visibility of open practices? You focus on the research group, the laboratory. 

How do we replcate our experience with OHI with other teams? The first thing I learned is to focus on thinking of the lab AS a team. 

We don't know what we don't know, adn we don't have time to learn it first be
Remove the pressure to learn it first

# Allison welcome to #rstats illustration

So with Openscapes, I'm really trying to figure out how to engage and welcome scientists in. And returning to the idea of visibility, 

focusing on early career faculty, lecturers, program managers. 
with early career faculty and lecturers. The reason I focus on early career lab groups is bc this is my generation of scientist, which means they have struggled with data as individuals and and it's s perfect opportunity to intervene and set a deliberate, r-inspired culture in their lab . 

particularly focused on ECRs. *[I do that because Without formal academic training, self-taught early career researchers are especially being left behind – and now in leadership positions as faculty, lecturers, and program managers, they are passing homegrown approaches to their labs. There is great opportunity to empower early career scientific leaders with our existing open science tools and communities so their labs can help uncover data-driven solutions faster.]*

&lt;!---[place here for Star Wars?] Put this for Openscapes&gt; THIS IS MINE. When I'm talking about this, this is how I describe it, give a nod to having used it before.---&gt;

# engage, empower, amplify

I've focused on engage, empower, amplify

goal is to complement existing efforts and help welcome more scientists to them. 

-5 months, i've also started doing them as workshops

I also like to talk about this with star wars analogies

# Empower
???
lesson series: 2 halves
For the most part, *not* teaching hands on. More of a "meet and greet", 
intro to communities like rOpenSci, RLadies, Carpentries, RStudio. 
intro to tools like GitHub issues, markdown. This is the only thing we do hands on: to smooth communicationand culture
identifying packages like the tidyverse, rOpenSci, etc. Not teaching them, meet and greet.

# Amplify
(tweet screenshots for these)

Don't just say I get to amplify them. I'm teaching them what amplification means for good mentors

We need to amplify people in our lab. Adrian is going to comment about Sam. 

???
And then I get to amplify them. I am so proud of their accomplishments. So I'm going to take a few minutes to brag about their awesome science.

Really focused on not only change inside the lab but outside.

This is Halley Froehlich, she's one of the leading world experts on aquaculture and global food systems. When thinking about food security, feeding growing populatinos, climate change, and human rights, she's one of the first people to COMPARE impact and emmisions across in the ocean and on land: comparing aquaculture and fishing to beef and chicken production. 

She participated as incoming faculty and is setting up her lab with open practices.

# Struggles this is limitations, a bummer. 

Moving forward, this is what we need to happen to make env scientists able to get the training they need. 

Current limitation, how to fix it. 
Have question marks in a table! I don't know how to fix this

- don't have time or support. I really see Openscapes treating the symptom not the problem: we need this taught more. Allison Horst has one of the few positions that I know, and it was on her own initiative that she turned this course from a largely theoretical stats course for environmental scientists to a hands-on data science course where she now teaches the tidyverse and GitHub.

- we've tested this in this pilot cohort, how to do in other struggles.

# 2 hex stickers

???
(revisit if this makes sense)

So that is my work to this point, I'm fundraising to be able to lead Openscapes full-time, and am co-leading our OHI internship program. 

But I wanted to end with what we can all do to become leaders in our communities.


How do we motivate others?

Talk about and show your colleagues how R makes you 

- a data scientist

but also 

- an author
- a web designer
- a designer
- a community member
- a leader

Say this to your colleagues: R makes me xyz

# Value

comes back to the value. 
lasting change in these labs, and will build out from there. 

I think Openscapes is a big part of the path forward and to not only welcoming more people to Rstats, but also extending rstats culture to other communities. And while I'm focused within my domain of environmental science, everything I've developed is discipline agnostic, ready to be used for other groups too. But this kind of community work is real work, and we need this valued and supported more too. 


BRING IT BACK TO R FOR SCIENCE COMMUNICATION AND CULTURE

# Thank you for this inclusive culture

(screenshot &lt;https://twitter.com/nceas/status/1137388818989047814&gt;?)

???
I want to end by saying thank you to this community for so many things, but particurly to its leadership in creating a diverse and inclusive space. I have learned so much about the importance of diverse and inclusive spaces, and this is an area that I in particular want to help extend these aspects of our culture to the environmental science community, and well beyond. 

Thank you.

Selection requirements: 

early career scientific leads (col 1)
- faculty
- lecturers
- program managers
- etc

- rising star, influential scientists that can also become ambassadors for ODS
- not yet engaged in open data science
- trust that I will not waste their time

I decided to focus on early career scientific leaders for a few reasons
But I was also having a lot of one-on-one conversations with colleagues of mine, friends from grad school who were now running their own labs. 

Early career PIs might not yet know about the Force. They may have struggled through like Luke in their PhDs, worked their butts off to secure faculty jobs, and are now leading their own teams. How about focusing on them?

Explicit statement:::::::
there's this aspect of open tools and the aspect of community. and we want this to be both. transition in the analogy: but once luke learned to use the force, he didn't go out adn defeat the empire on his his own. he needed his community. 

We need to focus on the tools and also on the community.

#STAR WARS STUFF

&lt;!---
But what happened then was that I quickly and sadly realized that I didn't have the tools or skillsets to work responsibly with my data. 

It was really demoralizing. And it was lonely and isolating. 

And the irony of feeling so alone is that most environmental scientists are also feeling lonely and isolated because of data. 

We are studying some of the biggest challenges our planets face, but we are largely on our own for data analysis. 

We are rarely formally taught how to code or work responsibly with data. Most of us do learn how to code on our own, but it is a painful, lonely process that we do just to get the job done. 

So that means we spend a lot of time reinventing the wheel and aren't proud of our code and aren't really eager for other people to see it. 

And we can feel like we are the only ones who feel this way so we don't really want to talk about it. 

transition: To drive home what this feels like, I like to talk about this with star wars analogies.

Luke

???

&lt;&lt;Careful saying "scientists" generally w/o qualifier

This is Luke after he crashed his plane in the swamp on Degobah. 

He is there staring at a challenge that he cannot solve with the skillsets he has. 

It is super demoralizing, and he has no idea how to even begin this process. 

Imagine for a moment if he had tried to rig up some pullees and levers. 

It would not have been pretty. Or reproducible.

transition: but what happens next is that he meets Yoda 


Yoda

???

And Yoda has a skillset to solve this challenge solve Luke's problem in a way he never imagined: he uses the Force. 

And Luke can learn from Yoda, and he will develop skills to not only solve this problem, but it will open his mind to what is possible and the challenges he can take on. 

transition: But the Force alone didn't make Luke successful, it is the community that he is a part of. 

Hands

???

Luke's community is not only Jedis with the same skillsets he has. This is a movement made up of diverse people (and droids, wookies, and whatever yoda is) from different backgrounds, and all of them contribute in really important ways. 

So the Force is R or more broadly, it's open data science. And the community is us, the people in this room. 

transition: And we can help welcome more environmental scientists into this community because


# /#rstats
Hands w/ logos: RStudio, rOpenSci, RLadies, Carpentries, Mozilla


???

Our #rstats community is so amazing. 

It is welcoming, it is inclusive, it is supportive, it is empowering. 

There is such a mix of people from diverse backgrounds and experiences, from all over the world, online and in person, innovating and learning together. 

What's different about our community is that we put people first and are really here to share ideas and learn together. It's what science should feel like. . 

This has been so impactful for me as a scientist. Instead of feeling stranded in a swamp like I did when I was a PhD student, I feel more powerful than I ever imagined. 

You here in this room have helped me change the way I do science and the way I think about what is possible. You have empowered me and helped me build confidence that translates well beyond code. 

We are all here because we have been empowered by R as a tool and a community, but we can all probably think of others that are still feeling stranded and alone. We might work with them day-to-day. 

transition: So my question is
