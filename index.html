NO UM START &gt;&gt; WELL

Well thank you so much, I am so excited to be here with all of you and I want to thank the organizers for this invitation. 

I'm a marine scientist and like many scientists I encountered a challenge in graduate school and am spending my career trying to solve it.

But this challenge is not about ecology or oceanography that you might expect from a marine scientist.

The challenge I'm dedicated to is helping scientists do better science in less time by creating community and learning to code. 

I've been mentoring and training scientist how to code and get started coding for 6 years now since finishing my PhD, and I'm going to share what I learned upfront:

///

These come through my experiences as a PhD student studying squid, through six years with the Ocean Health Index team and this R community, and with my most recent year with Mozilla and Openscapes. 

They are guiding principles for me, and what I advise for environmental scientists. But they are relevant much more broadly so I hope they will be useful for everyone here as as well.

&lt;br&gt;

### Open data science is a mindset
### Teamwork starts with openness 
### Harness the power of welcome 

???

The 3 lessons are

I'm going to spend the whole talk building out these lessons. 

They are the guiding principles for the program I've developed for scientists

And these principles come from my own experience as a scientist trying to work with data, struggling on my own as a graduate student and then struggling again with a team. 

But before we get to this let me start off with a bit about my experience research as a marine scientist, and what it's like for environmental scientists more broadly. 

When you see news headlines it can seem that science is a unified effort, but science really operates in pockets, with individuals working primarily within research groups, which we also call laboratories in the United States.

These research groups are often around a theme or topic, like a species, place, or method. My PhD lab was like this.

# Squid lab pic
 
???

We were a squid lab, broadly interested to understand how squid interact with ecosystems and drive economies through fisheries, and how climate change is affecting all this. 

transition: Although we had the same anchor, all of us in the lab focused on different pieces of this broader interest. 

---
# pic john field maps

I focused on adult behavior and migration, and how this is relevant to fisheries, conservation, and impacted by climate change

---
# pic chromatophores

???
 
others studied physiology, neuroscience, vision, and camouflage, which is really important since we have learned a lot about human neurons through studying squid neurons

---
# pic baby squid

??? 

also about development of squid babies, that are only 1 mm long when they hatch but can grow to be nearly my size in less than a year, meaning they eat a lot. 

---
# pic fieldwork

???

This meant we did a lot of work at sea and in the lab. We would go fishing and catch and release squid that we tagged with electronic tags so they would turn into little oceanographers as they swam. 

And we helped each other with our scientific work, we did field work with each other, helped keep squid alive in aquaria.

# Add slide? we worked together

# funny pic?

???

But it's not so smooth going. Because in all my education I had learned about physiology and ecology and oceanography. But I had never learned how to work responsibly with my data. 

And even though our research group would collaborate with each other with designing hypotheses and collecting data, we were eeach on our own to actually analyze our data. 

I learned how to code when all other options were exhausted. And that's because Excel was the only tool I knew, and it wouldn't work because the file was too big. 

This was not big data in the way that many of of you consider big data, but it was big to me, and it was panic-inducing. I actually considered breaking the dataset into multiple excel files and analyzing each by hand. It was a really dark time. 

But it gets better. 

I like to talk about it with analogies from Star Wars.

And Yoda uses the Force to solve Luke's problem in a way he never imagined. 

This is going to open up Luke's whole world because he can learn from Yoda and not only solve his current but it will broaden his mind to what is possible in the future.

Open data science is the Force that enables us to do better science in less time. 

And the rebel alliance is our community, everyone in this room. 

Having this community has been absolutely game-changing for me as a scientist. 

Instead of feeling stranded and deflated in a data swamp, I have a much broader and more optimistic mindset of what is possible with data, and that revolutionizes what I think is possible with science and how science can help tackle our biggest environmental challenges. 

And it is really critical that all environmental scientists feel this powerful and this supported, because for the most part they are not. 

So ever since I felt this way I've been helping others engage too. 

This started off as just being informal chats in our research group about data and workflows.

---
# Seaside chats

???

We call these seaside chats. The name comes from Roosevelt's Fireside chats, where he would share his thought process, daylighting all of his decisions and opening them up for examination.

Our chats are focused on setting up and maintaining standard operating procedures for our research group. We learn new skills and discuss folder architecture, filenaming, and code.

And then we started teaching our friends one-on-one and in small groups, and that's led to EDS being a 250-member group at UCSB. 

This has been really important for us to learn new things and learn how to teach,  
 And this was seen as a benefit to everyone, because the more collaborators with these skills the better for everyone.

# openscapes grassland w hex

and through all of this I've been thinking about what the problem is in environmental science and trying to identify identify where I can be most effective. And for me, I think that's what I'm doing with Openscapes. 

///

We want everyone to see and value what is possible and for them to engage and champion it in ways that align with their roles and responsibilities. 

So faculty can be most effective by supporting their teams, advocating for Carpentries workshops, and speaking up in faculty meetings about making it become official parts of the curriculum. 

Lab managers can become leaders within the lab, helping everyone become onboarded to the lab's github organization when they join the lab

And graduate students and postdocs who work with data every day can find common ground and vocabulary with data wrangling. 

And we do all research groups together because it's important to build alliances not only within labs but across them. Not only do we all learn more and it's more fun, but one of the main goals of Openscapes is to amplify our efforts nad each other so that these practices become more visible and more valued in environmental communities more broadly. 

///

I've just completed the first cohort of environmental scientists from 7 research groups, working with the supervisor and lab members together. 

The very first thing we talk about is that open data science is a mindset. so let's talk about that.

So let's think about agriculture. There might be an ecologist who is studying the role that bees play in pollinating crops, and how drought impacts this interaction. 

To do this she might collect data on the biology, behavior, and genomics of different bee populations, and combine that with data on water availability from snowmelt and groundwater. 

So she would have a lot of different data types to make sense of, from visual observations, genetic sequences, and from sensors on the ground and from satellites. 

transition: Her results help inform policy and management decisions around food systems, disease transmission, sustainability, and climate change.

She is likely working with governments at local and international scales to help inform change on the ground.

This picture here is the way science works right now, and what our education looks like. We are really good at theory, developing hypotheses, and experimental design. And we are getting better and better at communication and helping our findings get to the right audiences.

But there is this huge missing part here in the middle.

In the past, we got by filling this in as individuals creating our own homegrown approaches and not reporting about data methods in detail. 

But that is not working now: our data challenges have gotten bigger and faster and we are not prepared. 

transition: But as we know from Star Wars, open data science and teamwork can really complete this picture here.

???

I know this graphic looks familiar, but notice that all of the open data science components here are ringed by communities and support. 

R really streamlines how we work with data, and also streamlines how we work with each other. 

And streamlining this process from data to communication is critical for environmental science so that we can uncover solutions for our greatest challenges. 

Making this a reality in environmental science requires changes in mindset for individual researchers and cultural change in research groups, and change for how we support scientists with data. These are all big tasks. 

But I am optimistic because I have lived through this mindset change myself, and ever since I have focused on igniting this change in individuals and teams. 

I think there is a misconception that this is not already happening because scientists aren't aware of the tools, and that telling them to use GitHub will help complete this picture here.

From my experience, that is not the whole issue. 

Yes, in a lot of cases we aren't aware that better approaches or tools exist. That was certainly me with working with dates. 

But we also aren't aware of how tools could be beneficial to us because we have never seen them in a familiar context in a way that seems relevant to us. 

And when this is the case, we do not see welcoming entry ways to engage.

This isn't just using a tool, it's changing a behavior and a mindset. It's asking scientists to invest time and emotion in a whole new way of working, and they do not have time. 

So they see the benefit more, but no TIME ~or INCENTIVE~. but that is where teamwork comes in. 




---
exclude: TRUE

transition: I got through this, and we'll talk about how. But I think I learned to code the wrong way because I did not have the right mindset, ~and beyond my mentors I was not supported~. I was resistant and intimidated, and learned in a panic, just to get the job doen, and really lonely. 

&lt;!---
So even though we are coding it is often does not result in reproducible science because first off, the author of the code isn't proud of it and doesn't want to share, and even if she does it often is riddled with hard-coded local filepaths that only work on the author's computer.


and it was because of mentorship. And I experienced it similar challenges in my next role, it was because of mentorship and community. 

---&gt;

This whole data analysis experience can be super lonely and isolating.

# Open data science is a mindset

### data science • open science • open data science 

???

The first is that open data science is a mindset. 

Yes, it is also tools and practices for data analysis and reproducibility. 

But it is also an expectation that there is a better way to work, 

and it is confidence and willingness to figure it out and innovate. 

It's how the Force was not only a skillset but it broadened Luke's mind of what was possible and the scope of challenges he could tackle. 

///

A big part of Openscapes is creating welcoming entryways for scientists, and we start off by demystifying concepts.

So we'll do that here too with a few definitions

---
# data science 
 
???

From the news, it's pretty common to think that data science has a narrow defintion and means big data, AI, and machine learning.  

But AI and machine learning are not what most scientists need 


---
# data science 
hadley def
 
???

This definition of data science resonates with me.

The very first thing we talk about in Openscapes is a discipline, which means it has concepts, theory, and tools to work with data. 

And we talk about this as part that def. 

--
add R4DS hadley

???

This depiction of data science has these clear steps is the beginning of a way for scientists to see data science as something relevant to their work. And I love the emphasis on communication.

This figure has been incredibly impactful on my life. One of my biggest challenges as a scientist was that I could not abstract what were data challenges away from what were science challenges. 

That might seem like a really obvious distinction but it is something that I've struggleed with and I see others struggling with all the time. 

---
#pic on baot?

???

Because as scientists, we are on the forefront of discovery. We are asking questions that no one knows the answer to. And we have a mindset that anything we encounter is new and unchartered, and data challenges become completely interwoven into science challenges.

I spent two months trying to format dates in Matlab because since my data were from squid I thought that this was a squid challenge. I didn't have the expectation that formatting dates was something that people had encountered before.

And this is true of many environmental scientists. We don't even know what is possible, so we don't have the vocabulary or even the concepts to articulate our struggles and ask for help. 

I see this a lot when someone asks for heelp with code but they give me a 2 minute preamble to their hypothesis and study system but it turns out they want to rename columns. but can't articulate that. 

---
# pic breakfast

???

So something I tell Openscapes folks is about desayuno

So it is a big part of a mindset shift to start divorcing the science from the data and secondly to expect that the challenge is one that someone in the whole world has encountered before. 

So expecting there is a better way is a big part of this. And that is part of the mindset. 

---
# open science


???

Open science is another thing we discuss early on. This has many different definitions and even more interpretations. 

For many environmental scientists, including me as a graduate student, open science is not a positive thing. 

It means people stealing my data or misstruling my science. There are softer interpretations, where it means posting data and code publically at the end of a research study when the final manuscript is published. 

In interpreations like these, there is no benefit to the individual practicing open science. There is only cost in terms of time and risk.

So it's a lot easier to just avoid it. 

///
Open science as a way to be more efficient and streamlined
Not an added ask at publication to share your data 
External memory (personal and collective)
Easier on/offboarding
Find solutions faster – learn to talk about your data
Build confidence – skills are transferable beyond your science
Be empathic and inclusive – grow a network of allies

hampton quote
spectrum


???

I like this definition of open science

I teach that open science is a spectrum, with many entryways and paths to iteratively 

I like this too because it helps dispell the idea that you're either doing open science or you're not, and the activiation energy required to make that switch impossible task. 

Instead, what we talk about in Openscapes is how there are many entryways, and many ways to anticipate. 

Sharing a pdf of your presentation. Or using google slides. That is part of open science. 

OS spectrum. engage by sharing a talk online. create a GH org for your lab. have private repos while you get comfortable using it and working with a team with yor own data — but plan to click that button for public. That will change the way you work.

Using github, even in a private repository until you're ready to share, is part of open science because you're working with the intension of sharing.


---
# open data science

???

And open data science, what is this?


This is my current definition of open data science, which I've been modifying since I first published about it

But I'm not going to help people change their mindset and their behavior with definitions, no matter how much I've thought about word choice. 

it also means TEAM

I focus a lot on how this will save time: efficiency. but also happier
Now, seeing the benefit more, but no TIME or INCENTIVE

that's where teamwork comes in

// think about teamwork, which means identifying people that they can work with. Redefini

This is my core team, with the Ocean Health Index. I've worked with this team since I finished my PhD, so it's been over six years. 

It's with this team that I have gotten so into open data science, and have started those local communities in California. 

I'm going to talk through how our team operates, because with Openscapes I'm mentoring resarch groups to help them replicate this for themselves.

So for a touch of context, The OHI is a big project where we are trying on a to better understand and quantify the health of our oceans on a global scale, 

in a way that is useful and actionable for policy. 

The OHI focuses on the benefits that the ocean provides people

This is a figure from the paper showing how it took us less time each year to redo our work, and that it got easier to be reproducible and collaborate with others. In 2012 it took 4 years, and 20 team members. Now in 2019 it takes eight months, and 2 or 3 graduate student interns that we mentor parttime.

TODO: take more time to walk through. 

And this shows time, and time saved is money saved. 

In 2012 it took us 3M, and now in 2019 it takes 250K.

transition: but something that this figure does not reflect is how much being effective as a team was critical for this transition. So when I work with Openscapes teams I try to talk about it like this.

# Teamwork
### working openly • leadership • community

&lt;!---TODO WHAT DID WE OVERCOME TEAMWISE? TELL STORIES---&gt;

???

Our team works well because we work openly, we have supportive leadership, and we joined and created external communities outside our team. 

This has helped us stay a strong and positive team, even as the people on the team have changed, either by joining or moving on to other opportunities. 

I'm going to try to categorize things here but to be honest, the boundaries between team, collaborators, leadership, and community are pretty blurred, and I think that's a great thing. 

Having evolving ideas about what a team is and what a community is has been one of best things about this whole process.

---
# Working openly
TODO: a picture?

???

We work really openly with each other. We co-develop things, we share early drafts, and we are constantly giving feedback and iterating with each other. 

This means we had to feel safe with each other. 

We had to establish a safe space where we trust each other. 

We assume best intentions with everything we do. So critique and improvement come from the intent of making it better. 

and we are not afraid to fail, we actually share our failures and learn from them.

So for example, .... 

---
# Working openly
write these out in columns

???

Working openly takes internal investment from individuals and external investment for the team. 

It's about thinking what Future You might need but also what Future Us might need. 

So for example, we have a shared Google Drive and any presentations we create go there. Over the years we've shifted to use Google Slides more, and now it's easy to use figures or whole slides that others have created.
BUILD THIS OUT MORE

Thnk about this in terms of individuals and tone they set as a team


So for individuals, this requires being comfortable with vulnerability and being willing to share things that aren't perfect. 

It also means not being afraid of change, and being willing to change and learn. 

Being open helps immensely with tearing down imposter syndrome. Internalizing that no one can do it all is increcibly liberating and one of the most productive things you can do. Everyone thinks they are imposters in different context. But you aren't; you just have different skillsets. But being honest about this helps

Setting the tone

And then for the team, it means being inclusive and welcoming 

creating not just a safe space for yourself but a space where others can be vulnerable. This is a place you can share imperfect things because sharing it It will prabbly get better. Put it out there before it's done. It's better together. No one has all the answers. 

We also greatly respect each others' time. We start and end meetings on time. try to be realistic with deadlines

So for example

transition: in terms of creating a team around open data science, seaside chats were instrumental.

---
# Seaside chats 

???
I mentioned seaside chats before, which is really critical for establishing shared workflows. But is is also critical for teambuilding. They are fun. It's a time for us to discuss things we've learned etc.  . 

here's an example from Nina: Pathway

---
#hackathons pic bhi

???

We also have coopted the idea of hackathons, where we will all drop our own projects and come together for a day or an afternoon to do something that will benefit the whole group. 

So this is where we will actually overhaul our filepath conventions or refactor and modernize all our code with dplyr instead of plyr. 

In both seaside chats and hackathons we've also developed written protocols for onboarding new teammembers so that they can get upskilled and in our workflow as soon as possible.

With Openscapes, we've discussed doing hackathons to put data in one place and write data dictionaries and metadata.

---
# Onboarding

Not a concept that I had ever heard of until rOpenSci 2018. In science, despite there being a constant stream of students and post docs and research scientists passing through the lab, no systems for onboarding. 

This means that when someone started their first year would be past emails forwarded to them on-demand with attachments to try to parse out what to do. 

But what these shared practices, seaside chats, etc, do is create shared customs to make it easier for new peopel to get up to speed. And, when they leave the lab, you're not hoping they'll respond to your email and send some documentation to their code; it's already on GitHub.  


## `re:fwd:final data updated`

# pic happy hour / hike?

And we also prioritize social time, which is evident because all of our team pictures are selfies at HH. So a shared practice of enjoying wineries and beer gardens might be part of team building for us. 

This includes other shared nerdy interests as well

# Leadership

pic Ben Halpern


???

This is Ben Halpern, he's the lead of OHI and also the director of NCEAS, the ecology center where we are based. 

He set this tone for our team, and also critically, modeled a healthy work-life balance and boundaries 

He has played a huge role in our data science story... MEDS will start in Aug 2020
because he  to pursue it, he has funded us to go to conferences, . 


And this is really critical. He is not a coder himself but saw its value and gave us space and trusted us to learn data science and implement shared practices for our team.

So when I work with the research leads in Openscapes, I we discuss this specifically. How their role does not have to be to learn R, but they can still champion it. They can enable it in their labs, they can support their lab members to go to conferences, they can advocate for it to be taught. 

And Michelle Stuart!

But he is super engaged in what this enables us to do, and is a huge champion for open data science at NCEAS and Univ California where we work

transition: so back to our OHI team. Ben's leadership style has also fueled us to become leaders ourselves

////

Also able to strengthen community across labs. 

We were able to bring the faculty and lecturers together in person and I was surprised what an effect that had on the second half of the program. 

Up to them they had understood that all of this was powerful and they knew I was really excited about it, but they left the summit actually feeling it for themselves.

Community for me has really been redefined. env sci, R, and moz communities.
 
And engaging in R and this R community for me started on Twitter, believe it or not.

My teammate Jamie encouraged to join twitter to learn R. 

I was definitely skeptical. I did not use Twitter because I thought it was a megaphone for angry people. 

I didn't realize it was a place to have thoughtful conversations with lovely people, and most of all is is a way to listen and learn with others. 

So I was amazed that you could have community on Twitter

and I was also amazed that developers were real people. And not only that, they were super nice people that made me feel welcome and valued even as I was feeling insecure about my coding skills. 

Prior to these communities I had never stopped to think that there were real people behind software.

I mentioned RLadies and Eco-data-science

We invested a lot of time into creating a bigger community at UCSB. EDS, RLadies. Worth it. The more people who have these skills, the better for EDS. but more directly selfish, the more people who can help us when we have issues or teach us new things. The more people who we might potentially hire who already have these skills. In one glorious example, our OHI Fellows that we hire now come in w more training bc of Allision Horst

# pause
we've jut talked about a lot. Something that comes up all the time is how to stay on top of everything and learn everything. And the secret is, you can't. And internalizing that is quite liberating. 

For me, I tell folks use the internet as your external memory. write little breadcrumbs to yourself and then use the power of Google or GitHub search to help you find what you need. You see a cool new package on twitter but don't have time to play with it? Scrolling through and seeing screenshots posteed and conversations around it will be enough for you to remmber it's useful. 

But because we can't do it all, teamwork is more important.

---

So that's all to say that teamwork was critical to OHI's success. 

These are these intangibles that scientists don't normally talk about. 

I try to build this with openscapes by first of all modelnig this with the cohorts themselves.

# open data science &lt;-&gt; teamwork doodle

???

the communities we're in here have grown out of the interest in the tools. but that's not the entryway for everyone. I've been focused on the reverse process, trying to create solid teams that are stronger because of ods. 

////

The more I reflect on this the more I realized is that data science and teamwork exist together in a feedback loop that streamlined how we work and innovate. 

Learning and using similar software promotes and streamlines teammwork. And also working as a team better equips you to learn open practices data science.

You really need both. Trying to engage solely with open data science without teamwork can be lonely and deflating. And only as a team but without the best collaborative software can be inefficient.

transition: This is a loop that feeds back on itself. For me, and likely for a lot of us in this room, this becomes difficult to differentiate and tease apart.

# TODO ods-teamwork-loop doodle

???

So it took our Ocean Health Index team 4 years to learn how to work as a team and use open data science tools. 

That's too long. That's too long for anyone but especially too long for our environment and climate change.

So how do we accelerate this and make it so that it isn't such a painful and long process for other labs?

When I started Openscapes, I expected to work with science teams and help them get to the open data science. But need to do the reverse.

# Harness the power of welcome
### create a safe space
### prioritize communication
### connect through the internet
???

So what I'm trying to do with openscapes help create spaces where scientists feel safe talking about their data and workflow challenges, listen to them, and provide direction and paths forward for what to do. 

This means being a friendly face and encouragement for others, and thinking about where they are coming from.

I have realized that researchers who are doing amazing env science might be really intimidated by data science and they might need to be welcomed. 

I learned this early from the folks at rOpenSci and RStudio with their commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive space. 

And it has been a big part of my experience and education with Mozilla, and a foundational part of Openscapes.

# OLX

# communication

redefined. 
in terms of websites. For us in OHI, this is now blogdown, bookdown, simple rmd websites, jekyll websites. 
for openscapes, something we did on the call was create GH accounts, and write readmes from the browser. that's some people's first website. the thrill of having something you've done on the internet is amazing

I learn things all the time too. You can publish google docs and they then look like websites and are self-refreshing. Amazing.


///
But using R and GitHub completely changed how we think about communication and what's possible for science. 

We can do everything online. Not just all our code and data are online throughout the process, 

but RMarkdown made us become web developers and can and share things along the way, not only at the end. 

And it also enabled us to create a whole international online training program and provide tech support. 

This is a huge deal for environmental science, since there are so many different audiences involve and being able to communicate as data decisions are being made rather than only at the end is huge.

# Open source science

&lt;!--- Others can more build off of our science because they can build directly off our code. ---&gt;

What all of this does is create open source science. 

It is easier for anyone to build off of our science because they can build directly off our code. 


transition: working this way has made our initial intention and dream to become a reality, which is to have independent groups be able to lead their own OHI assessments.

# OHI+ map

And we have had over 20 groups using our science and our code to do OHI assessments in the places they care about.

# Horst.github.io
For Openscapes, it means that the amazing data science course materials that Allison Horst creates for environmental scientists in California can be used by Michelle Stuart in New Jersey to create and teach a new course. 

It means that Chelsea Wood in Washington can create an intro to ecology course and share ppts. 

And what this all means is that we do open source science.

# squid closure

going back to squid, open data science would have helped me immensely, not only to have had more confidence and been effective sooner, but also for reproducibility. My code only easily runs on my laptop from 2012 with its filepaths. But I don't have licenses anymore. 

But still, here I am. And now I’m doing this presentation at an R conference, in R. What I was able to overcome and what I could do. 


---
# Closing thoughts

These are all in the shorter term, but really, they do not address the bigger problem that this is not supported more fully at the institution and university levels. 

I've mentioned that we lack time, but we also lack instutituional support and incentives. 

I believe in this work so much but not something that is funded in the traditional structure of science. 

?Squid reprieve?
I got through this because of a few patient mentors who helped me learn how to code. I could not have done it without them. PcFB
&lt;!---
My code was reproducible back when I wrote it, and when I got another squid tag back close to finishing, I could rerun. 
---&gt;

I know this is probably the case for a lot of people with their PhD code but it hits you hard when you learn that someone is scraping data from you published figures because they couldn't run your code on their computer. That's just not the way we want science to work.

&lt;img src="img/openscapes-hex.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

 OPENSCAPES IS MAKING THIS WHEEL

# Openscapes operations


- inaugural cohort was 7 research groups (22 scientists)
- Faculty/lecturers/program managers and members from each research group participate 
- online mentorship program, 5 months, using Zoom and Google Doc
- 2x per month we get all participants from all labs together on the same call.

# super vague but good words

???

This is not about hands-on training or coding, but indstead about creating a culture of teamwork and an expectation that there are better ways to work, and pathways to improvement. 

The first half of the program we focus on teamwork and culture within the research group, and in the second half we transitioned to the open data science tools that enable better science in less time.


So for teamwork, we focus on creating supportive leadership in a data science and digital context, helping research groups become teams, and helping them discover and engage with online communities and participate in and start local communnities.

How imporatnt env science is to other things. Ag and health. 
Maybe fits into the mindset: willing to be need to become  comfortable with putting yourself out there and your work out there before it's perfect. It will prabbly get better. Put it out there before it's done. It's better together. No one has all the answers. 
---&gt;


&lt;!---
Steph::

before you can become a team you have to feel safe. safe to fail. 
There's the people part
and there's the env part
. you can share when things aren't perfect and trust that people won't make you feel like an iditio. inclusive
people part: you hve to ave people that are willing to do that. willing to be vulnearable. It takes strength to be vlunerable. 
And you have to have people that are not afraid of change, are willing to change. willing to learn. openminded to try new ideas. aren't afraid of failing. and if you fail, share what went wrong. 
failure is such a part of openness. And a part of tearing down imposter
communication is key: talking face to face, documenting pracitces. 

one more piece: not just in yourself being vulnerable
And encouraging others is important. encouraging others to be vulnerable. Not just creating your own safe space and creating a safe space for others. 
Creating a space where others can be vulnerable too. 

How to get rid of cruft: write a POP for my presentation. Make sure that everything leads back to my POP

# wrap up 

so openscapes hasn't solved all of these issues yet 

→ could also frame positiviely: i haven’t solved all of open science, even in the first openscapes champions here are some struggles that I had trouble advising and I want to figure out to do better and help mentor better. If others are in this boat we could frame together. 
Could say: I’m really interested in talking with people of how to move this forward. Diff from “you need to support me”
If i’m talking about future challenges: how you find funding to support this kind of mentorship that is not part of how scientific resaerch tends to get funded. It’s a systemic weakness. It’s not me specifically unfunded. It’s systemcie
It is hard to find funding to support thes initiaitves


What’s been challenging and what we’re still working on as a more collaborative community.

And the awesome thing is that we all have our part. 

a critical thing is that anyone can step up and be a leader. 

And the easiest/fastest way is to welcome and encourage others with open data science and teamwork.

And if you yourself are unsure you have a team or feel like you're on the outside of the feedback loop or on the threshold, know that since you're here so you're already part of it. 


ENDING: so we can all think about this in our own situations and also think of how we can support environmental scienists...

in a time when env sci is our most pressing probs are related to env it's critical that those scientits have the tools and team to answer those quiestions using data.

&lt;!--- Memorize this and tempo. And what I'm offering as part of the solution. 

One of final slides
"this is powerful for science" &gt;&gt;&gt; it's part of this for science. but it's also powerful for people. mental health, leaky pipeline, burnout. and maybe include this too. This is really powerful for science and individuals and teams. 

---&gt;






&lt;!---
challenges ops?

biggest challenges:
- labs dont think like teams
- pis feel they should leearn first

big ops
- talk to colleagues

comes back to making this more visiblee so can be more valued

how do you set up good practices for the lab when you do not know those practices yourself? And if you don't have time to learn, and they're always changing? 
- I feel it. Need help with databases. 


Obstacles
And there are obstacles, the primary being time, especially when this investmentis not evaluated or rewarded broadly in the academic structure in regards to promotion and job security. 

And there are opps but challenges as teams. how do you lead well when you dont know?
