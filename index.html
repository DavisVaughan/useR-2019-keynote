NO UM START &gt;&gt; WELL

TODO LANG

Well thank you so much, I am so excited to be here with all of you and I want to thank the organizers for this invitation. 

I am a marine ecologist and R as a language and as a community has been game0changing for my science, and my life. 

So much so that over the past six years I have been moving away from doing my own research so I can pay forward what I've learned and focus on enabling other scientists to better science in less time, together. 

Throughout this I've learned several lessons, and I want to share them up front:

# Lessons learned 
&lt;br&gt;

### Open data science is a mindset
### Teamwork starts with openness 
### Harness the power of welcome

???

The 3 lessons are Open data science is a mindset, Teamwork starts with openness, and Harness the power of welcome.  

I'm going to spend the whole talk building out these lessons. 
But first I wanted to tell a bit about me adn what it is like to work in a marine or environemtal research group, which we also cll laboratories in the US.

So I am actually a squid ecologist, and my PhD research group focused on squid. These are photos from our field work at sea, studying a really incredible squid that can get nearly as big as I am. 

That is me on the right, releasing a squid back into the ocean with an electronic tag that turns it into a little oceanographer as it swam.

Our research required a lot of teamwork, both at sea and in the laboratory. 

In short, we were a typical research group that collaborated around the science.

# everything is fine meme TODO

But we didn't act like a team when it came to data. 

Analyzing data was something that was left to each of us to figure out as individuals.  

+

In all of my education I had never learned how to work responsibly with data. 

I wasn't comfortable with computers, and I was intimidated by the thought of coding, and I saw no clear paths to learn. 

I learned how to code when I accepted the reality that I could not process everything in Excel, which was the only tool I knew.

But I was lucky to have some colleagues who mentored me and spent countless hours helping me learn to code. 

And I actually felt how powerful coding can be for science. 

I like to talk about this in terms of Star Wars.

Open data science is the Force that enables us to do better science in less time. 

And it fuels our community, which includes everyone here.

For me, it means that instead of feeling stranded, I have a much broader and more optimistic mindset of what is possible with data, and what is is possible with science and the environmental challenges we face.

&lt;And it is really critical that all environmental scientists get the opportunity to be this powerful and this supported, because for the most part they are not. &gt;?

I began my jedi training in graduate school as an individual but it really accelerateed when I joined my current team and learned by working together with them.

And since then, my journey has happened over years and through cumulative experiences.

THis is our story about our path to bsilt using R, RStudio, Git and GitHub. We describe how we made this shift when we faced a reckoning that the way we were doing data analysis was not reproducible even by ourselves.

And it's been really in the last year that I've been able to try turning these ideas into a program to help teams actually acheive it. TODO

And this was because of the fellowship I've had over the past year with with Mozilla

So what I've seen through all of these experiences is that although research groups are all different, thre is a pattern to it all:

And we are getting better and better at communication and helping our findings get to the right audiences, to inform dexisions around food systems, disease transmission, sustainability, and climate change. 

This picture here is the way science works right now, and what our education looks like. 

It's how our squid reasearch group worked. And it's like most others I've seen

But there is this huge missing part here in the middle where data is combined, wrangled, and analzed

In the past, we have managed as individuals creating our own homegrown approaches and not talking about it like it was a critical part of science.

But this approach is not working now: our data challenges have gotten bigger and faster and we are not prepared. 

transition: But as we saw from Star Wars, open data science and teamwork can really complete this picture here.

Because R streamlines how we work with data, and also streamlines how we work with each other. And this is critical for environmental science so that we can uncover solutions for our greatest challenges. 

I know this graphic looks familiar from R4DS, but notice that all of the data science components here are ringed by communities and support. 

And from my experience, making this complete picture a reality in environmental science is not just about skillsets. It is about mindsets. And it's about culture shifts. 

Because remember how luke felt when he was stranded: many of us feel like that. We don't see examples of how this could look JENNY

But I am optimistic we can make this happen because I have made this transition myself, also because Openscapes participants are well on their way after only 5 months.

# Open data science is a mindset

### expect a better way • build confidence &amp; willingness • reimagine science communication

???

This is one of the first things we discuss in Openscapes. 

Open data science is a mindset involves data science and open science and is creative and collaborative and fueled by what is possible with the internet. 
It's how the Force was not only a skillset but it broadened Luke's mind of what was possible and the scope of challenges he could tackle. 

And to help get into that mindset it's important to understand current mindsets and how to help reframe them.

# Expect there is a better way

???
TODO lang MAYBE DROP THE DATES AND FOCUS ON EXCLUDE
Expecting there is a better way to work with your data can be at odds with the mindset you have in science. 

Because as scientists, we are asking questions that no one knows the answer to. 

In my squid research, no one knew where these squid behaved in California, my data contained secrets on the forefront of discovery. So when I needed to reformat dates into ISO-15(?), this was a task completely interwoven with my squid. I did not expect that this was not something I had to do from scratch. 

Part of why I couldn't expect there was a better way is because I didn't have any idea of what was possible, and I also didn't have the vocabulary to articulate our struggles and ask for help.

This definition resonates with me because I can see myself included in it. 

transition: And to be able to acgtually see data analysis as a graphic that has as discrete steps —

&lt;!---
We talk about data science with this definition: that data science is the discipline of turning raw data into understanding. 

This is a definintion that resonates with environmental scientists, because we can see this as being useful in our own work. 

And this is important, because if you just read about data science in the news, you can come away with a pretty narrow defintion that it means big data, AI, and machine learning. 

And that immediately excludes many scientists who could benefit so much from what I feel data science is, a discipline concepts, theory, and tools to work with data.

# Build confidence &amp; willingness

???

The next is build confidence &amp; willingness to engage in a different way to work. 

And open science is a big part of this. 

Open science has many different definitions and even more interpretations. 

For many environmental scientists, including me as a graduate student, open science is not a positive thing. 

It means people stealing my data or misstruling my science. There are softer interpretations, where it means posting data and code publically at the end of a research study when the final manuscript is published. 

In interpreations like these, there is no benefit to the individual practicing open science. There is only cost in terms of time and risk.

So it's a lot easier to just avoid it. 

///
Open science as a way to be more efficient and streamlined
Not an added ask at publication to share your data 
External memory (personal and collective)
Easier on/offboarding
Find solutions faster – learn to talk about your data
Build confidence – skills are transferable beyond your science
Be empathic and inclusive – grow a network of allies

I like this definition of open science

I teach that open science is a spectrum, with many entryways and paths to iteratively 

I like this too because it helps dispell the idea that you're either doing open science or you're not, and the activiation energy required to make that switch impossible task. 

Instead, what we talk about in Openscapes is how there are many entryways, and many ways to anticipate.

# Reimagine science communication

Also, we can reimagine science communication, using the internet. For a long time, science communication happens at the end of a study, and it is is one-directional, and it's hard to access. 

Now, with the internet, we can make websites, we can connect with collaborators on slack, we can have video calls, we can screenshare. We can read a blog post about someone's research and talk to them on twitter. It's amazing. 

Despite being super into the internet and software, I can be a big curmudgen about introducing new software into my life and creating new accounts. 

But that's why I love that I can do so much with just a few tools:

This figure illustrates how it took us less time each year to redo our work, and that it got easier to be reproducible and collaborate with others. 

The circlese show it took less time every year and also along the axes it was easier to reproduce and easier to collaborate with our future selves, which means Future Me and also Future Us. 

In 2012 it took 4 years, and 20 team members. Now in 2019 it takes eight months, and 2 or 3 graduate student interns that we mentor parttime.

Reduced time is important for repeated environmental aassesmments that are are repeated each year to track change over time, and it also reduced our costs substantially.

# Teamwork starts with openness
### working openly • vertical &amp; horizontal leadership • community

???

Teamwok and collaboration are such powerful things for innovation as well as for emotional well-being. And that is because no one can do it all, and we need to shed the expectation that we should. 

Teams to me means rings of people you respect, collaborate with, and can rely upon. It does not have to be limited to a certain deliverable, location, discipline or anything else. 

Teamwork is critical in science because no one it can do it all. 

I'm going to try to categorize things here but to be honest, the boundaries between team, collaborators, leadership, and community are pretty blurred, and I think that's a great thing. 

Having evolving ideas about what a team is and what a community is has been one of best things about this whole process.

And so much of what I've learned is from the Open Leaders program. 

OL is... created by Mozilla Science Labs and Open Leadership and Events team.

As you've seen, I've modeled what I teach in openscapes after our experience with OHI,

But I modeled the program architecture after Mozilla's Open Leaders program. This architecture includes deliberate focus on welcoming people and creating safe spaces. 

And doing so by blending teamwork and open tools.

TODO lang SEE BELOW TOO
Working openly takes internal investment from individuals and external investment for the team. 

It's about thinking what Future You might need but also what Future Us might need. 

So for example, we have a shared Google Drive and any presentations we create go there. Over the years we've shifted to use Google Slides more, and now it's easy to use figures or whole slides that others have created.
BUILD THIS OUT MORE

Thnk about this in terms of individuals and tone they set as a team


So for individuals, this requires being comfortable with vulnerability and being willing to share things that aren't perfect. 

It also means not being afraid of change, and being willing to change and learn. 

Being open helps immensely with tearing down imposter syndrome. Internalizing that no one can do it all is increcibly liberating and one of the most productive things you can do. Everyone thinks they are imposters in different context. But you aren't; you just have different skillsets. But being honest about this helps

Setting the tone

And then for the team, it means being inclusive and welcoming 

creating not just a safe space for yourself but a space where others can be vulnerable. This is a place you can share imperfect things because sharing it It will prabbly get better. Put it out there before it's done. It's better together. No one has all the answers. 



Strategies for creating a team culture are creating opportunities for talking about, learning, and doing data things together.

TODO pic

An unsexy secret about data science taht no one advertises is that it involves a lot of bookkeeping. Where do we put things? what are they names? This takes a lot of time by everyone. LEt's have a system. Jenny Bryan's quote YES

seaside chats are informal meetings that are are focused on setting up and maintaining standard operating procedures for our research group. We learn new skills and discuss folder architecture, filenaming, and code. 

 which is really critical for establishing shared workflows. But is is also critical for teambuilding. They are fun. It's a time for us to discuss things we've learned etc.  . 

here's an example from Nina: Pathway

////


We also have coopted the idea of hackathons, where we will all drop our own projects and come together for a day or an afternoon to do something that will benefit the whole group. but is no one's responsibility directly

So this is where we will actually overhaul our filepath conventions or refactor and modernize all our code with dplyr instead of plyr. 

In both seaside chats and hackathons we've also developed written protocols for onboarding new teammembers so that they can get upskilled and in our workflow as soon as possible.

With Openscapes, we've discussed doing hackathons to put data in one place and write data dictionaries and metadata.

# Onboarding / offboarding

???

oo are critical concepts for science. eac hlab has people coming and going. you'll get keys and intro to lab equipment and safety

But tese are not conceptes in the digital context

Not a concept that I had ever heard of until rOpenSci 2018. In science, despite there being a constant stream of students and post docs and research scientists passing through the lab, no systems for onboarding. 

This means that when someone started their first year would be past emails forwarded to them on-demand with attachments to try to parse out what to do. 

## `re:fwd:final data updated`

And that's ineffective and also pretty dangerous for reproducibility. Because attachements get lost, and it means that everyone is having to take time doing the collaborative bookkeeping that github does, and the cumulative time that people spend downloading and organizing could make some real headway on env. 

But what these shared practices, seaside chats, etc, do is create shared customs to make it easier for new peopel to get up to speed. And, when they leave the lab, you're not hoping they'll respond to your email and send some documentation to their code; it's already on GitHub.  



transition: one final thing that we do as an OHI team, and that is critical, is that we prioritize social time

# happy hour &amp; hike

And we also prioritize social time, which is evident because all of our team pictures are selfies at HH. So a shared practice of enjoying wineries and beer gardens might be part of team building for us. 

TODO We're kind with each othe. We look out for each other. This takes effot and we prioritze it

Also, critically, we have a healthy work-life balance and boundaries. So we respect each other, and that is reflected in time, work, and social. 

transition: So this is all critical to operating like a team and being able to engage effectively and collaboratlively with ODS

And this team culture was ignited and nurtured by really supportive leadership.

This is Ben Halpern, he's the lead of OHI and also the director of NCEAS, the ecology center where we are based. 

He set this tone for our team, and has played a huge role in our data science even though he is not a coder himself. 

And this is really critical. 

As a leader he listened to our excitement and he supported us to invest time and resources in open data science, and he trusted us to implement shared practices for our team.

He's making environmental data science a priority at NCEAS, and has also spearheaded a new masters program in environmental science at the University of California 

transition: so with Openscapes, I also mentor the research group leads individually so that they can become champions for open data science and have an oversized influence like Ben has had.

We all had agency and support to become leaders within our lab group, and beyond. 

This is Ben Best, Jamie Afflerbach and me. They are my teammates but they have also been  leaders for me. Ben spent countless hours sitting with me and teaching me R and was patient when I deliberately made emails from github go to my spam folder because I thought GitHub was not going to be useful to me. 

And Jamie is an amazing leader as well, I'll tell a story about her in a moment. 

And together we are partners in crime. We cofounded EDS with other friends and have taught multiple carpentries workshops together. This is us preparing for the Shiny conference in 2016.

Each month in addition to the Cohort calls with everyone, I would have one-on-one calls with each lead. Here they are: they are early career faculty and lecturers. 

They are already influential in their fields, and doing really critical work. But when we started Openscapes, they were not yet thinking about open data science or teamwork like we've been talking about, and this gave them a chance to engage. 

We covered a lot of ground in these calls; we'd talk about strategies for championing open data science in faculty meetings and we'd screenshare and practice using GitHub with RStudio. 

But a main theme was how their role at this point in their careers might not include learning how to do pull requests, but they but they can still champion the broader picture.

They can enable open data science in their labs, they can talk about it in their seminars and lectures.

One example is Nishad Jayasundara. halfway through the program he could no longer join the full cohort calls because of a new teaching commitment. But he supported his lab members Molly and Remy to continue working with the group and bringing what they learned back to their lab. 

So the idea for for the one-on-one mentoring is really about creating more visible ambassadors for open data science.  

And this kind of vertical leadership is critical. But leadership comes not have to only come from the top. There is horizontal leadership too, and in fact anyone can be a leader. 

transition: so back to our OHI team. Ben's leadership style has also fueled us to become leaders ourselves

Community for me has really been redefined by this R community. 

Back in 2012 I had my feet squarely in marine science, but now I feel so energized to be bridging not only marine science but environemtnal science with the R community and the Mozilla community.

My teammate Jamie encouraged to join twitter to learn R. 

I was definitely skeptical. I did not use Twitter because I thought it was a megaphone for angry people. 

But she taught me how to use it to to listen and learn from other others. And then to gradually build up the courage to like and retweet things. 

And that this was not only a way to become part of the community yourself, but it was a way to welcome and amplify other people who might be unsure of what they were doing too.  

So I was amazed that you could have community on Twitter

So, rOpenSci and RStudio. I'm deliberately limiting myself by putting them on the same slide here because I could talk about both of them. 

They have been so supportive and welcoming fromt the get go. And it was so exctiging to be able to particitae in unconfs and dev conferences

They have created communities where developers and new users who are strangers become collabortors and friends and where there is deliberate attention to setting the right space to make that happen. 

It was a big deal to not only connect online, but also in person, with so many other people in these communiies. It really solidified that we were part of this. And I wanted Openscapes to have this same opportunity

So midway through the Openscapes program, we were able to get the research leads together in person in California. 

Not only this give them an opportunity to meet each other as scientists who are engaging in open data science, but we tried replicate what I have experienced at rOpenSci and RStudio conferences and we included Sean from the R community and Christie Bahlai from the Mozilla community. 

So I had high expections about how awesome this would be but they were exceeeded.

data science and teamwork exist together in a feedback loop that streamlines how we work and innovate. 

Learning and using similar software promotes and streamlines teammwork. And also working as a team better equips you to learn open practices data science.

TODO:: I'm not going to get into all the details but those issues I mentioned above were solved like this: 

repro: .xls --&gt; .R
collab: fwd --&gt; GitHub issues (simplified)
comm: static pdf --&gt; RMarkdown-based websites


???
And finally for communication, we thought about this in terms of how we shared our data and methods. 

For scientists using traditional tools, communication is really limited to the end of a project when everything can be wrapped into a PDF and data put on a remote server somewhere.

# Openscapes operations


- inaugural cohort was 7 research groups (22 scientists)
- Faculty/lecturers/program managers and members from each research group participate 
- online mentorship program, 5 months, using Zoom and Google Doc
- 2x per month we get all participants from all labs together on the same call.

# Open source science

&lt;!--- Others can more build off of our science because they can build directly off our code. ---&gt;

???
 
What all of this does is create open source science. 

It is easier for anyone to build off of our science because they can build directly off our code. 


transition: working this way has made our initial intention and dream to become a reality, which is to have independent groups be able to lead their own OHI assessments.

# OHI+ map

And we have had over 20 groups using our science and our code to do OHI assessments in the places they care about.

# Horst.github.io
For Openscapes, it means that the amazing data science course materials that Allison Horst creates for environmental scientists in California can be used by Michelle Stuart in New Jersey to create and teach a new course. 

It means that Chelsea Wood in Washington can create an intro to ecology course and share ppts. 

And what this all means is that we do open source science.

# squid closure

going back to squid, open data science would have helped me immensely, not only to have had more confidence and been effective sooner, but also for reproducibility. My code only easily runs on my laptop from 2012 with its filepaths. But I don't have licenses anymore. 

But still, here I am. And now I’m doing this presentation at an R conference, in R. What I was able to overcome and what I could do. 


I know this is probably the case for a lot of people with their PhD code but it hits you hard when you learn that someone is scraping data from you published figures because they couldn't run your code on their computer. You feel a big responsibility to help others do better than you did.

# super vague but good words

???

This is not about hands-on training or coding, but indstead about creating a culture of teamwork and an expectation that there are better ways to work, and pathways to improvement. 

The first half of the program we focus on teamwork and culture within the research group, and in the second half we transitioned to the open data science tools that enable better science in less time.

So for teamwork, we focus on creating supportive leadership in a data science and digital context, helping research groups become teams, and helping them discover and engage with online communities and participate in and start local communnities.

# Save for Q&amp;A: the time it takes to build communities

???

A question I get in Openscapes is the time it takes to build local communities, and is it worth it. 

And our experiens, worth 1K times over. 

Not only are you creating a bigger pool scientist who have these skills, and could be potential collaborators or lab members in the future, EX halley gordon, tidytuesday

It also creates a kind and positive culture, which is something we need to cultivate in environmental science. 

//

We invested a lot of time into creating a bigger community at UCSB. EDS, RLadies. Worth it. The more people who have these skills, the better for EDS. but more directly selfish, the more people who can help us when we have issues or teach us new things. The more people who we might potentially hire who already have these skills. In one glorious example, our OHI Fellows that we hire now come in w more training bc of Allision Horst

# Save for Q&amp;A: how to keep on top

???
we've jut talked about a lot. Something that comes up all the time is how to stay on top of everything and learn everything. And the secret is, you can't. And internalizing that is quite liberating. 

For me, I tell folks use the internet as your external memory. write little breadcrumbs to yourself and then use the power of Google or GitHub search to help you find what you need. You see a cool new package on twitter but don't have time to play with it? Scrolling through and seeing screenshots posteed and conversations around it will be enough for you to remmber it's useful. 

But because we can't do it all, teamwork is more important.

# breadcrumbs thoughts

???

In Openscapes, I talk about how open data science has made the internet become my external memory, fueled by Google and GitHub search. 

As I find things that are useful to me I try to leave little breadcrumbs to myself by writing about them in blogs. 

I learn from others' work that they share, but I also try to learn for others by writing up my experiences and putting them online. 

transition: so I've shown a lot of what the OHI does with open data science tools, so it is fine time time to intro you to the OHI team
