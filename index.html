KEEP IN MIND

Environmental scientist doing research. "How can we bring this to science" is way too big

each slide is 2-3 sentences. percision of speech. every word should be throughful and precise. to create emphasis of tihngs

no: "i've been thinking a lot about" yes: "the question I ask: how can we ..."

add one sentence: environmental problems are critical. what a bummer what they don't 

this is my work, I'm neck-deep if I am asking the question if this is ncessarry? The answer is no every time.

Need to anchor beginning

The community that R is a part of. We are from finance and science and developers!!! Community of Jedis Put faces

Ignore this: not many jedis, elite. Not eeveryone? But in the world of R everyone can be a jedi? Have a resonse

I mentioned data layers but didn't say data needs
Show our maps: maps are important for showing spatial things for communication
Cornwall website things: tell a story about Cornwell. Why are they doing this? In Cornwall they are having issues with overfishing

The fact that I'm goinving a talk aobout an R conf and never talked abou tthis at an ocean conf speaks to the imporatnce. 

I instead of we

My whole thing is a bout team. A big part of this is about my personal transoforamation but it's really about the team. So my  story is the team story. 

Ending::: need a super summary to bring back to my main message: teams and openness. End with the profound single statement. 
Now that you've heard all of this you can see how teams are so important. But need to end with core message

You can do open science without being part of a team so this is something I am trying to work at. Core message. Visual

It's not about fixing problems it's about making something good even bnetter

Nature 2012 had a huge impact. But now accelerated impact. But the fact that we do it better now doesn't mean it wasn't good science the first time, it's just better and faster now. 

Data challenges have gotten bigger. And tools are here to ameiliarte. In the past the tools weren't even necessary. Didn't have asatellites. NOw we are seeing . Everything is happening faster. Need tools to meet these challenges. Until fairly recently haven't been available for the normal humans to use. Everything has changed, we need to get with the program. 

it's not that the science we do now is bad, it's better because it's faster, more open, streamlined, inclusive. 

Reorg Allison notes Jun 27
Nail down pacing and no ums

A goodie for their brain. Places where you can remind people of what they've already lerned is awesome. And a great way to transition.

What are our secrets section: like it but didn't work
those secrets seem vague. People want concrete things. 
It's OK if I say those things later on. Have a preview 
Move those. 
Before we did this data science updates stuff this is what people like. But those secrets put this at the end. 

this will shorten OHI part and set up Openscapes
And then I say is this is a feedback loop intertwined and working together. Positive feedback loop. So it took us 4 years to realize this. How do we make it so that it isn't so terrible and long process for other labs. 

transitiongremind why you talked about OHI
so we spent 4 years learning how to work as a team using ODS tools. In Openscapes I wanted to decrease that effort. That's waht drives Openscapes. get you from that big circle to the smaller circle in less time. 

Openscapes recipe connect this to the lessons learned from OHI&gt; 
aspects of leadership and community
Cut the cohort summary. 
Cut the wods in the openscapes labs. 
*****They want to know the lessons learned. **** more imp than details. 
My personal story then OHI's story then Openscapes story and here's what I've learned throught his process so that
weekly meetings with calls, the point is doing this. 
CUT WORDS. a few high-impact sentences on each lessons learned.

Call to action part
return to loop
Yes we can learn the data science tool and when it comes to team building
Mindset shift to get into it. 
Empathy
Keep in minds soemthing i think is surprising: people we look at who are doing really amazing env science might be really intimidated by data science and they might need to be welcomed. 
Just bc someone is a brillant env scientce, they might still need help welcoming bc they are doing some of the toughest stuff in the world right now. 
&lt; big pic recap: people answering raelly imporant qs in en sci don't always have the tool and teams they neeed but there are ways to welcome and empoer them to do bettere science in less time. 

comfortable not broadening past env sicent
env science should be a thing that intersts everyone
Qs: do you think this is true in othere fieelds? 
A: yes absolutely

Make big high-impact statement. OHI is a big deal. don't worry about overstating. make it a keynote.

Q for Allison:

- Nature figure 1, use original? Or simplified?

---&gt;

???

NO UM START &gt;&gt; WELL

Well thank you so much, it is so amazing to be here with all of you and I want to thank the organizers for this invitation. 

I am going to talk today about how we can welcome more people to use R for better science in less time.  

transition: I am going to focus on welcoming marine and environmental scientists, so I wanted to start by giving a sense of what we do, because I know some of you might have your own ideas

Studies like these make it seem that science is a uniformed effort that streamlines data into results.

But science really operates in pockets, with individuals working within research groups and laboratories, as well as across them.

transition: research laborties are often around a theme or topic, like a species, place, or method. My PhD lab was like this.

# Squid lab pic

We were a squid lab, broadly interested to understand how squid interact with ecosystems and drive economies through fisheries, and how climate change is affecting all this. 

transition: Although we had the same anchor, all of us in the lab focused on different pieces of this broader interest.

I focused on adult behavior and migration, and how this is relevant to fisheries, conservation, and impacted by climate change

others studied physiology, neuroscience, vision, and camouflage, which is really important since we have learned a lot about human neurons through studying squid neurons

This meant we did a lot of work at sea and in the lab. We would go fishing and catch and release squid that we tagged with electronic tags so they would turn into little oceanographers as they swam.

Really incredible opportunities to learn about these animals and make a difference for fisheries, for ecology, for people.

But it's not so smooth going. Because in all my education I had learned about processes etc. I had never learned how to work responsibly with my data. 

And even though we are part of a lab, part of a group that is unified around science, it can be really lonely and isolating when it comes to data bc we don't have the skills, mindset, or support. It can be really intimidating to engage in data science and learn to code, especially when we also do not see examples of its benefits in our own context, and we are not aware of welcoming entry points to engage.

This is Luke after he crashed his plane in the swamp on Degobah. 

He is demoralized because he cannot solve the problem before him with the skillsets and tools he has.

And Yoda uses the Force to solve Luke's problem in a way he never imagined. 

This is going to open up Luke's whole world because he can learn from Yoda and not only solve his current but it will broaden his mind to what is possible in the future.

So open data science is the Force that enables us to do better science in less time. 

And the alliance is our community, everyone in this room. 

Having this our community has been so game-changing for me as a scientist. 

Instead of feeling stranded in a swamp like I have several times in my scientific career, I feel more powerful and supported than I ever imagined. 

And I want all environmental scientists to feel this powerful and supported. 

transition: This is critical because I just told you about my data challenges for my squid research, but this is really a broader problem in marine and environmental science.

For example, an ecologist might be studying how bees pollinate crops that are important for agriculture. 

To do this they might collect data on the biology, behavior, and genomics of different bee populations, and combine that with data on water availability from rain and snow. 

Their data would be a combination of observations, genetic sequencing, and sensor data on the ground and from satellites. 

transition: And their findings are impactful and important to communicate to different audiences.

Their results help inform policy and management decisions around food systems, disease transmission, sustainability, and climate change. 

As environmental scientists, we are often working with governments at local and international scales to help inform change on the ground.

And we hhave a lot in common with the open source community because we are working for the public good, and passionate about our work. 

But data challenges have gotten bigger and faster; we are not trained to collect and manage and combine and analyze the types of data that we require to do our work.

transition: But I know that open data science and teamwork can really complete this picture here.

The interplay of open data science and community can have resounding impacts on environmental science — because R streamlines how we work with data, and also streamlines how we work with each other. 

To make this a reality we need to not only welcome more environmental scientists to the R community, but also simultaneously extend our values and our ethos to the environmental science community.

It requires changes in mindset for individuals to make change in the culture as a whole, but I know it is possible because I have lived through this mindset change myself, and I have spent the last 6 years igniting cultural change in environmental science. 

transition: But over the last year with a fellowship from Mozilla, I've been focused on doing this more formally through program I've developed called Openscapes.

&lt;br&gt;

With Openscapes I'm focusing on building this culture at the core community unit of science, the research group or laboratory. 

Openscapes is a mentorship program for these labs, helping them engage with open data science and become visible examples and vocal champions for open data science within their broader communities. 

We've just completed the pilot cohort of this mentoring program with 7 research groups, and I'm excited to tell you all about it bc I am so proud of what they accomplished.

But to tell the Openscapes story I need to first tell the Ocean Health Index story. 

And that's because I designed Openscapes based on what our team experienced with the Ocean Health Index, and it is now probably the most visible example of how powerful open data science can be for environmental science. 

transition: so let's talk about the Ocean Health Index

With the OHI we are trying on a to better understand and quantify the health of our oceans on a global scale. 

To make this useful and actionable for policy, the OHI focuses on how the ocean provides benefits to people, and models it with the best publically available data and science. 


&lt;!---

"OHI is used by UN to try to quantify impacts and benefits" &lt;&lt; that shuld be their takehome

And in order to do the big questions with the science, we had to get our ducks in a row for data science.

From all of this, we create maps like these, with scores reflecting how healthy oceans are for every coastal country around the world. 

And ever since, we have repeated this work every year so that we could understand how ocean health changes through time. 

This is a really massive novel scientific undertaking, and for us, it also meant to do sound and reproducible data science

But we did not know how. 

transition: when we first developed the OHI in 2012, we had files like these. 

but we fixed it, with ODS. nature paper. then fig.

We were marine scientists using the tools and approaches we had learned along the way. 

Our team was wrangling and modeling nearly 100 datasets and planned to repeat this every year in the future. 

And we truly thought that this approach would be reproducible, and were pretty deflated when it was not

This is a figure from the paper showing how it took us less time each year to redo our work, and that it got easier to be reproducible and collaborate with others.

In 2012 it took us 3M, 4 years, and 20 team members. Now in 2019 it takes 250K, eight months, and 2 or 3 graduate student interns.

This change took time and and I think why it has really resonated with people is that we shared how hard this transition was for us. 

transition: Because we really face a reckoning with the way we worked with data, and we had to completely change the way we had always worked and seen other people work.

# Reproducibility
# Collaboration
# Communication

???

We share how we upgraded the way we work in terms of repro, collab, comm. 

It took us a long time to categorize our work like this because it required abstracting data science steps from our ocean health index steps. 

We had never thought about what were data challenges universally held by everyone and what were science challenges we faced with ocean health. So teasing these apart and articulating them was a big part of this story.

Not only did shared convensions with R help our coding, but shared convensions with GitHub helped our project management and our documentation. 

Using GitHub for all of this was really helpful for onboarding new teammembers.

And finally for communication, we thought about this in terms of how we shared our data and methods. 

For scientists using traditional tools, communication is really limited to the end of a project when everything can be wrapped into a PDF and data put on a remote server somewhere.

But communication changed for us because we could put everything online. All our code and data are online throughout the process, and we were able to create websites and share things along the way, not only at the end. 

This is a huge deal for environmental science, since there are so many different audiences involve and being able to communicate as data decisions are being made rather than only at the end is huge.

And we have had over 20 groups using our science and our code to do OHI assessments in the places they care about.

# pic of Jamie Twitter profile

First, my colleague Jamie made me join Twitter. 

I had never used Twitter before, so I was definitely skeptical. I thought it was a megaphone, I didn't realize it was a place to have thoughtful conversations with people, and most of all is is a way to listen and learn and connect with others.

On Twitter I was amazed that I could learn from and interact with coders and developers.

We learned about things like dplyr and devtools that were in the works, and also started getting comfortable looking to github to install packages.

I was really blown away that developers were real people, and real people that were super nice and that we could talk with. 

Prior to this I had never imagined that there were real people behind software. 

transition: Honestly, it had never occurred to me that software was written by people. And by nice people! in all of my previous experience, the closest I'd ever come to a software developer was

The second thing that was really transformative for me is we went to the rOpenSci unconf and met many folks in person.

It was a big deal to be feel so welcomed here, and it really broadened my thinking of what community is and what teamwork is. 

I really started feeling that this was more than code, it was a better way to work and a better way to do science. 

this was really the defining point in my life. This is was that turning point when I really became the person I am today — that person who never stops talking about R and data science and open science and community.

Our OHI team felt really empowered. And all of this was reflected in our work. 

Everyone on our team used GitHub to share and discuss ideas, even if they were not coding. 

For our analyses we were working with a common set of tools, set up systems for organizing and naming files. We started doing spatial analysis in R,

This helped us think in the same way together.

We've come a long way. 

Now, we are still repeating that assessment each year, but to do so we actually started a fellowship program for graduate student interns: we train them in data science and how our team works and they lead the assessment. 

Like I said, OHI is used by 20 groups around the world, and will be included in the UN's ocean indicators for the Sustainable Development Goals. 

OHI has become an example of how how open data science can be game-changing for science, particularly in environmental science.

# Nature paper reprise

Additionally, our better science in less time story has been really well received.

However, it does not fully hit the mark for kick-starting everyone to engage. I've gotten feedback that it still feels unachievable to people and excludes people who don't feel like they were part of a team. 

Our story really focuses on the tools, but not on the communities around them and how important they are for learning and sustaining these skills and practices. We didn't really talk about how to truly join and create communities. 

transition: so I have reflected a lot about this and —

---
# open data science &lt;-&gt; teamwork doodle

???

A main thing I've realized is that data science and teamwork exist together in a feedback loop. 

Learning and using similar software promotes and streamlines teammwork. And also working as a team better equips you to learn data science.

This is a loop that feeds back on itself. For me, and likely for a lot of us in this room, this becomes difficult to differentiate and tease apart. 

You are a great team because you use the same tools, but using the same tools help streamline how you work as a team. 

It becomes both team culture and data science tools that streamline how we work. 

transition: so it's what we're talking about here

But what if you are currently outside of this loop? 

What are the entryways to get into it?

scientists are doing good science, but how do we make it better? How do you welcome them into this loop, empower them with what is possible, and amplify their successes within their communities?

I'm interested in how these labs can do better science in less time and champion this within their own communities, ultimately increasing the visibility and value of data science and teamwork within environmental science.

&lt;img src="img/openscapes-hex.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

So this has become the main focus of my work now, through Openscapes. 

Openscapes is to help scientists find welcoming entryways to this data science — teamwork loop. 

Particicularly interested in the leadership and team aspects of open data science. To have targeted impact and help accelerate this cycle. 

goal is to complement existing efforts like the Carpentries, RStudio, rOpenSci and help welcome more scientists to them.

# Openscapes secret recipe &lt;reword!

I designed Openscapes to recreate what was so critical to us with OHI. It needs a supportive team lead, a team, and entry ways to get jazzed about R and open data science. 

And I work with the leads and lab members together, and am in a way trying to recreate what we have with our OHI team, where the team lead values it and enables it, and the team is really jazzed about what is possible and has agency and paths forward.

# Openscapes recipe

1. team lead valued &amp; supported us &gt; faculty, lecturers, program managers (TODO: color)
2. act like a team

And to have the most targeted impact, I'm focusing on team leads who are already doing impactful science and are leaders in their disciplines. 

The idea is that if these scientists who already have influence can also be role models and champions for data science, we can create ripples throughout science and change the culture as a whole.

PATHWAY

What we teach in the series

For the most part, *not* teaching hands on. More of a "meet and greet" to communities like rOpenSci, RLadies, Carpentries, RStudio. 

The point is to see what is possible and discuss how it fits in with their ongoing work and really help create these mindset and culture shifts

The first half is really focused on team culture: we talk about Codes of Conduct, on developing a mindset for sharing and shared practices within the lab, in a data science context. So we talked about what onboarding looks like from a data science perspective. 

We did interweave data science here too, to facilitate team work: we set up lab GitHub organizations as and talked about using GitHub issues and markdown as way to record ideas.

And in the second half we focused more on data science tools and how to learn them with communities. 

This is where we learned about some of the packages in the tidyverse and rOpenSci suites. We talked about how RLadies, #tidytuesday, and Mozilla study groups are really imporant ways to learn

But throughout, the point was to have time and space each month to exposed to and empowered by what was possible, and to have some accountability in trying to integrate it into workflows, no matter where everyone and individuals as well as labs, were starting from. 

Bookdown.

Let me say too that I've been developing the lesson series in bookdown — this will become a textbook for Openscapes although I've got a lot of work to do.

But I'm writing this book not to be specific at all to environmental science: it is discipline agnostic, ready to be used for other groups too. But this kind of community work is real work, and we need this valued and supported more too. 

Twitter is a part of this: teach how to engage but also how to amplify

# break into screenshots

The pilot course was modeled after Mozilla's Open Leaders program. 

5-month remote course, also piloting on-demand workshops for teams. 

Each month I meet one-on-one with the lab lead, 

And also each month we meet twice with all lab leads together, plus their lab members. 

These calls are 1.5 hour and in them I try to teach only 30 minutes, so that the maximum time can be discussion of how this could work within each lab context.

We have discussions as a group and also use a feature in this video conferencing software that lets us do breakout rooms so that we can discuss in smaller groups and mix up the labs. 

ALSO SCREENSHOTS OF GOOGLE DOCS
&lt;!---And each one ends with some hands-on "efficiency tips" ---&gt;

2. We were a team &gt; laboratories, research groups &gt; have agency to do it

???
The purpose for working with lab members and leads is so everyone learns and sees the value and power of what's possible, and that the leads feel comfortable letting their labs develop these skillsets, and the lab members have agency and paths forward for what to do 

So through this process, everyone is really starting to value it as individuals and as labs. But making this more visible to broader networks is critical as well,

quote

When I asked Chelsea to be a part of Openscapes, she essentially told me that open science and data science wouldn't be useful to her lab, but that she was willing to participate since I was asking her to. She thought that open science meant sharing data at the end of a project along with publication, and had no sense that it was a bigger spectrum of tools and practices that were actually designed to make science better the whole way through, and not just add extra work at the end of a project.

# Chelsea quote

Chelsea is now an ardent supporter of open science and data science. She and Danielle, who also participated, have gotten the lab up and running with GitHub, and are sharing course materials online.

Malin started his lab 6 years ago and there are 20 people 
The biggest change for this lab was really feeling like a team and establishing shared tools and workflows for the team. When I first interviewed Malin about Openscapes, I asked how lab members shared data and code and methods with him. He said that depending on the person, information was shared through Dropbox, Google Drive, GitHub, email attachment, or thumb drive. This helped frame the

Allison has upgraded her stats course and now not only teaches the tidyverse but also GitHub. She also got all of her course materials online and created this website for her students to be able to access everything more easily. 

This means that every year, when nearly 100 students complete their masters degree they join the workforce in government, conservation and other aspects of environmental science and management, and they take these skills with them. 

&lt;!---
She has also shared all her courses online and created a website — and something that is awesome is that Michelle who I just mentioned is going to be leading a new course at Rutgers using these lessons herself.

# Lessons Learned

# Lesson 1: Team building is important

???
This is something I realized early on: that didn't think of themselves like teams

Labs were not necessarily thinking of themselves as a team so much as a collection of individuals doing their own thing. 

It's like everyone is operating like Luke Skywalker did, even when they are sitting next to each other in a lab and working on similar themes.

That was certainly the case for me in my PhD laboratory, but I hadn't really realized that that was being carried forward into young labs led by my generation of scientists. But they have never seen anything different or seen how data science tools could enable and strengthen teamwork.

Seaside chats for homework.

transition: This includes mentors giving space and promoting mentees

- how do you set up good practices for the lab when you do not know those practices yourself? And if you don't have time to learn, and they're always changing? 
- I feel it. Need help with databases. 

---
# Lesson 5: Need open data science taught and supported in departments

???
support: hire lecturers
support: data managment, backup. Every faculty shouldn't have to on their own figure out whether AWS or local servers is the best way. They are busy doing science. need help. 

---
# open data science &lt;-&gt; teamwork

???

These labs are now in this feedback loop: they have the aspect of open tools and data science and the aspect of community. and we want this to be both. 

transition: but there is still a long ways to go until —

---
# horst complete fig

???
until science as a whole really operate like this. 

And I do think that Openscapes is an important way to help ignite this change, and I am so proud of what we accomplished. And I will be continuing to lead these online cohorts, and also lead short-form workshops with teams on the ground. So I'm really excited about it.

But truly, Openscapes is not the long-term solution. Scientists should not be learning this on their own time through pockets of opportunity. 

What we really need to make this picture complete is to value this enough in environmental science that it becomes part of formal education, that we hire and compensate excellent environmental data scientists to teach these at the university, and that these practices become part of the evaluation process for what it means to be a scientist. We need to value all of these things in environmental science more. 

We need labs to operate like this, and have common skillsets and mindsets that make collaborations between labs and individual people's transitions between labs more smooth. 

transtion: And beyond, in other scientific fields, and beyond.

# So what can we all do — Rey

???

Openscapes is one way I'm trying to help people find teams when the team already is defined. 

But what if they don't exist. 

Not everyone has a defined team around them, or maybe they don't realize they have them and need to engage but also they might now. 

Maybe need to realize what you have. What if you don't. We all have a team but don't realize it. How to buildt

# Power of Welcome
horst welcome to #rstats illustration

&lt;!---
In the last section, don't assume have a team. Build up a story or message about how to find your team.
---&gt;

???
So what can we all do as individuals? 

I do think that it's all about the power of Welcome, as Stef Butland puts it. 

I think back to how intimidated I was to coding and the idea of open science, and how life-changing it has been for me. And the most important part was being welcomed and supported. 

I think we all can do our part to become leaders and champions for these practices in our own worlds, and welcoming more people to have this mindset. 

We need to extend the ethos of this R community to our faculty meetings, our board meetings, or project updates, etc. Managers employees/senior developers

We can advocating for opportunities to learn, which in academia means courses and dedicated lecturers to teach them. 

And if you yourself feel like you're on the outside of the feedback loop or on the threshold of this Welcome know that since you're here you're here so you're already part of it. 

&lt;!---
Talk about and show your colleagues how R makes you 

- a data scientist, but also
- an author
- a web designer
- a designer
- an inspired and supported community member
- and a community leader

---&gt;

&lt;!---
Have question marks in a table! I don't know how to fix this

- don't have time or support. I really see Openscapes treating the symptom not the problem: we need this taught more. Allison Horst has one of the few positions that I know, and it was on her own initiative that she turned this course from a largely theoretical stats course for environmental scientists to a hands-on data science course where she now teaches the tidyverse and GitHub.

# Thank you for this inclusive culture

(screenshot &lt;https://twitter.com/nceas/status/1137388818989047814&gt;?)

???

I want to end by saying thank you to this community for so many things, but particurly to its leadership in creating a diverse and inclusive space. I have learned so much about the importance of diverse and inclusive spaces, and this is an area that I in particular want to help extend these aspects of our culture to the environmental science community, and well beyond. 

Thank you.

# /#rstats
Hands w/ logos: RStudio, rOpenSci, RLadies, Carpentries, Mozilla


???

Our #rstats community is so amazing. 

It is welcoming, it is inclusive, it is supportive, it is empowering. 

There is such a mix of people from diverse backgrounds and experiences, from all over the world, online and in person, innovating and learning together. 

What's different about our community is that we put people first and are really here to share ideas and learn together. 

We are all here because we have been empowered by R as a tool and a community, but we can all probably think of others that are still feeling stranded and alone. We might work with them day-to-day.

# data_analysis_v2.xls
data_12_11_12.R
re:fwd:final data updated

???

Our story starts off here, in 2013. 

I know this looks painful but we had been doing data processing in whatever way we had all learned on our own previously. Most was in excel and a bit in R, with decisions documented in accompanying Word documents and emails. 

So then the year I started when we went to repeat the analysis, there was a lot of forensics and detective work to uncover what we had even done the first time, much less figuring out how to repeat it. 

*[What strikes me about this now is that these ways we had all been working had gotten us far, our team had PhDs and masters degrees and are now working at a really prestigious center. So these homegrown ways got us far for a little while as individuals, but they did not work as a team. ]*

Needless to say, we needed a better system. So here is what we do now. And again, this was over a four-year period, and we continue to iterate and improve.

# Actually being reproducible 

TOO much GitHub (esp with IT.)
Instead, show a few examples of ways that we use to use R for comm. 
NO BULLETS.
that we can generate for each country. 
Maybe just the word "simple RMd websites"

Work on no "and" transistions with bullets.
We had a boss even thought they weren't using R, gave us space. 
Maybe numbers are less tedius "next", "second"

Slide where I say "Box 1 and Box 2". if you don't expect people to read it, dont put it here. There's a of info here b ut whe I want you to know
Box 1 is relataed to ds skills and workflow and Box 2 is the culture and comm
OTHERWISE DON"T PUT THEM IN THERE.
if you want people to realize NSSD&gt; it then you have to point it out
Some of our resources are the NSSD podcasts and nontraditional resources for building our skills and community. 

Maybe just include part of [Table 1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160/tables/1)? 

(maybe bullet this, and animate?)

# original porrige ramble

All of this has had me thinking about how software enables teamwork and teamwork enables software. I'm going to try talking about this here; I have trouble articulating it but think it is really critical for moving forward. 

So thinking about it from the software side, there is software that is designed to streamline teamwork. So for example, Google Docs lets you co-edit and therefore co-think together in real time. GitHub helps you collaborate with others. And there are also things like the tidyverse that help create shared social norms that make it easier to work as a team. 

On the other side, if you are on a team or community you might have more courage to engage in new software; RLadies chapters, meetup groups, #tidytuesday

So for a lot of us in this room, this turns into a feedback loop and get almost difficult to differentiate and tease apart. so it might be less of a loop but more like a porridge...

And OHI is an example where one person with knowledge of the software enabled the team to engage, which meant more of us were using the software, which then strengthened the team norms and culture. 

And eco-data-science starts at the other side maybe, where it was a group of friends asking one person with knowledge of R how to learn, so it went from the team to the software and then 

But the reason I'm thinking about this is because of entry points. What if you are outside of this loop. You might use software, but not really with any collaboration or teamwork in mind. Maybe you don't even feel like you're part of a team. 

How do you engage and welcome people in those cases? 

transition: thinking about this was a big part of how I designed Openscapes. Really wanted to focus on how software can streamline teamwork and teams can learn how to use software.

# R and data science have incredible potential accelerate scientific research

Data science and teamwork have incredible potential accelerate scientific research. They can help uncover solutions to our most pressing problems, which in the environmental space where I work include food security and sustainable resource use on land and in the oceans.

But many environmental scientists are being excluded from this potential. 


we are wrapped into our science.

# We lack a supportive scientific culture and opportunities to learn

???

We lack opportunities to learn data science and we lack a scientific culture that supports us to incorporate it into our research. 

My experience, and the experience of my other lab members, is typical. And not just for marine biologists, but for ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and all sister domains that can fit into environmental science. 

It is not even a part of our culture to talk about data practices, which makes teamwork and collaboration more difficult since we do not have the mindset or really even the vocabulary to do so.
