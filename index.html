&lt;!---KEEP IN MIND

Environmental scientist doing research. "How can we bring this to science" is way too big
When I say science = = "bring #rstats to science" what does that mean
"when I say bring to science the level I'm talking about is here" 


TOO MANY WORDS&gt; the most important things get lost if each is a full paragraph

each slide is 2-3 sentences. percision of speech. every word should be throughful and precise. to create emphasis of tihngs


instead of saying "i've been thinking a lot about" "the question I ask: how can we bring this ethos to env sci". That's been guiding my efforts

add one sentence: environmental problems are critical. what a bummer what they don't 

storyline is good in the intro. Stop changing it. This is good. Get the words nailed down so that they're great and precise. 

Then, we can talk about whether we don't talk about env science enough. WEDS

in next few days say intro bare bones. 

R has changed my life, and so much that now I'm actively working to have it to change the lives of more scientists like me.

---&gt;

???

Thank you so much, it is so amazing to be here with all of you and I want to thank the organizers for this invitation. 

R, data science, and the open web have incredible power accelerate scientific research. They can help uncover solutions to our most pressing problems, which in the environmental space include fresh water availability, food security, reduced disease transmission, and sustainable land use.  

But many environmental scientists like me are being excluded from this power. 

We are excluded because we lack opportunities to learn and a supportive culture within science. *[because we lack skillsets but also mindsets and culture.]*

Right now, there are many scientific disciplines that do not value data science and open practices. And I say that because on the whole we do not teach them in environmental science, and we do not reward them. It is not even a part of our current culture to talk about data practices, and so we do not even have the vocabulary to do so. *[There are not a lot of paths to participate; you have to seek them out on your own and make the time. computing and data science are additional disciplines but we are expecting the same amount of people to tackle them]*

But I know we can change this culture following the example of the R community. 

I know that because I have lived through it myself and I have spent the last six years igniting pockets of cultural change with colleagues around the world.

r4ds minus hadley

???

Right now, this is what env science looks like.

We are deeply interdisciplinary, and are experts in the different domains we work in. For example, scientists studying fresh water availability need to be experts in domains like hydrology, freshwater ecology, and in political systems. 

And we are similar to the open source community because we are working in the public good, passionate about our work. We are working to keep species alive, water clean, food systems sustainable, and to reduce infectious disease vectors. 

And we collect and work with a lot of data. And our resulting findings are really impactful for policy. This means that communication and collaboration are really valued.  

And most of us do end up coding to be able analyze our data. But it is an intimidating, isolating struggle. We are never taught to work responsibly with data. And coding is often an intimidating thing that we resist before having to learn just enough to get the job done, and in a total panic. This means we're not really proud, which means we are less inclined to talk about it and share it. And this perpetuates the culture of not talking about it and therefore not valuing it. 

I want to be really clear that I am not trying to belittle environmental scientists. We do amazing work on complex, ever-changing systems. And many of us are on the front lines studying the effects of climate change, and it is emotionally draining. Additionally, there are many examples of great environmental scientists who do value R, data science, and open practices. 

But I think we need to be honest about the culture as a whole, which does not value data science and open practices in a time when we do not have time to waste. JD Long just mentioned this quote on an RStudio community call: "A problem well defined is half solved" and I think it we can identify barriers situation and the barriers to progress are both technical and mindset.

r4ds complete [idea: for culture have hearts and logos: rOpenSci, RStudio, RLadies, Carpentries, Mozilla, Twitter: a spin-off of Rey]

???

We need data science to be part of our skillsets, but we also need a positive, collaborative, open culture. 

And R provides both.

R streamlines how we work with data, and also streamlines how we work with each other. 

And not only because of R as a tool but bc of R as a community.

The R community has created a positive space for people like me to be welcomed as human beings and encouraged as coders. And it is so powerful for innovation and collaboration, and we've seen this community grow so much; I'm thinking in particular about RLadies, rOpenSci, RStudio, and Carpentries communities. 

We talk a lot about the R community and welcoming more people into it, which I wholy support and actively do. I want to simultaneously welcome new community memebers and also extend our values and our ethos to other communities as well. 

&lt;!---
And R has created this whole community here, with roots in shared passions. Env scientists also have shared passion already, focused on the planet. They can broaden that passion to R [uggh]
---&gt;

---
(something)

???

So I want to focus on culture shift that needs to happen so that we value data science and open practices in the environmental science community. 

[place here for Star Wars?]

I've developed a program called Openscapes, particularly focused on ECRs. *[I do that because Without formal academic training, self-taught early career researchers are especially being left behind â€“ and now in leadership positions as faculty, lecturers, and program managers, they are passing homegrown approaches to their labs. There is great opportunity to empower early career scientific leaders with our existing open science tools and communities so their labs can help uncover data-driven solutions faster.]*

It is based off of the last 6 years working with the Ocean Health Index, and what we have learned. So I'll start there and then tell you about Openscapes, which is the best.

Takehomes are that we can all create real change in our own ways. And it just takes one person's passion to really ignite change in communities, it is quick to cascade. I'll give examples of the different ways I've seen leadership in this space, from being infectiously jazzed about R, to not having personal interest in learning but seeing its value. 

&lt;!---
And these days especially, coding is only a piece of our computing responsibilities, even if it is a big piece. But it goes along with organizing, storing, and sharing files, keeping track of versions, and remembering what the heck everything is. And this is true whether we are talking about grant proposals, photos from field work, but also data and code.  
---&gt;


There are shared coding norms for working with data, and also shared social norms for working together. Both of these are deliberate, and they make it all work. 


And this community has grown by so much because it's been so welcoming to people like me, who can otherwise be outsiders.

I am a marine ecologist, and #rstats has been life-changing for me. 

???

Thank you so much. I'm so thrilled to be here today.

I am excited to share my work with this community, which has had such a huge impact on my work and on my life. 

R has been so game-changing for me that I have been moving away from doing my own research so I can enable other scientists with R and open data science more broadly. 

Today I'll share a bit about me and focus on two environmental science programs I've been leading with my teams at NCEAS and Mozilla. Both depend on R for analysis, but also on R for communication and culture. 

&lt;&lt; keep this super clean/polished as opening statement

pic montage of me at sea, mbari squid?

???

First off, here is a peek into the life of a marine ecologist. For my PhD, I studied an awesome squid that can be as big as I am. 

It is one of the biggest fisheries in the world, which means that there are a lot of them, and they play an important role in the ecosystem and in our global food economy. 

They live only in the Pacific Ocean, traditionally between Chile in the south to Mexico in the north. 

But for about 15 years, they extended their habitat range northward, into the US, Canada, and even Alaska. It was a big deal. 

We wanted to understand their behavior and impact they were having on California ecosystems, and if climate change was involved.

So how do you study something like this? You can either fish for them and bring them to you, or you can use a remotely operated submarine and go to them. We did both. 

To prepare for my field work at sea, I needed to learn about oceanography, specifically how temperature, oxygen availablilty, nutrients, and currents work in the Pacific. 

I also needed to learn about squid in general, as well as California ecology and fisheries. 

transition: I got to collaborate with a lot of scientists and learn from them.

---
pic: tagging squid

???

Finally I got to go out to sea and catch squid! I released some of them back in the ocean with a data logger on them. That would make them become little oceanographers themselves, with data stored on the logger and then uploaded via satellite. 

It was super cool. We collected data every second, which meant you'd be able to see them breath, since they move by jet propulsion and their breathing is coupled with swimming. 

---
pic: holding tag

???

So after all this work you can imagine how cool it was to get this data logger back and actually hold the data in my hand. 

But what happened then was that I quickly and sadly realized that I didn't have the tools or skillsets to work responsibly with my data. 

It was really demoralizing. And it was lonely and isolating. 

And the irony of feeling so alone is that most environmental scientists are also feeling lonely and isolated because of data. 

We are studying some of the biggest challenges our planets face, but we are largely on our own for data analysis. 

We are rarely formally taught how to code or work responsibly with data. Most of us do learn how to code on our own, but it is a painful, lonely process that we do just to get the job done. 

So that means we spend a lot of time reinventing the wheel and aren't proud of our code and aren't really eager for other people to see it. 

And we can feel like we are the only ones who feel this way so we don't really want to talk about it. 

transition: To drive home what this feels like, I like to talk about this with star wars analogies. 

---
Luke

???

&lt;&lt;Careful saying "scientists" generally w/o qualifier

This is Luke after he crashed his plane in the swamp on Degobah. 

He is there staring at a challenge that he cannot solve with the skillsets he has. 

It is super demoralizing, and he has no idea how to even begin this process. 

Imagine for a moment if he had tried to rig up some pullees and levers. 

It would not have been pretty. Or reproducible.

transition: but what happens next is that he meets Yoda 

&lt;!---
**this is the feeling when you don't have the toolset. but you can learn when you have a community ** Don't overexplain the metaphor.
---&gt;

---
Yoda

???

And Yoda has a skillset to solve this challenge in a better and more efficient way: he uses the Force. 
&lt;!---didn't even know existed---&gt;

The Force can solve Luke's problem in a way he never imagined. 

And Luke can learn from Yoda, and he will develop skills to not only solve this problem, but it will open his mind to what is possible and the challenges he can take on. 

&lt;!---Luke's ability and successes don't come individually, this comes from supportive environments.---&gt;

transition: But the Force alone didn't make Luke successful, it is the community that he is a part of. 

&lt;!---But also a super important part is that it's not just about the tools (Force) and the people that know them (Jedis).---&gt;

---
Hands

???

Luke's community is not only Jedis with the same skillsets he has. This is a movement made up of diverse people (and droids, wookies, and whatever yoda is) from different backgrounds, and all of them contribute in really important ways. 

So the Force is R or more broadly, it's open data science. And the community is us, the people in this room. 

transition: And we can help welcome more environmental scientists into this community because

# /#rstats
Hands w/ logos: RStudio, rOpenSci, RLadies, Carpentries, Mozilla


???

Our #rstats community is so amazing. 

It is welcoming, it is inclusive, it is supportive, it is empowering. 
&lt;!---we stand up for each other---&gt;

There is such a mix of people from diverse backgrounds and experiences, from all over the world, online and in person, innovating and learning together. 

What's different about our community is that we put people first and are really here to share ideas and learn together. It's what science should feel like. . 

This has been so impactful for me as a scientist. Instead of feeling stranded in a swamp like I did when I was a PhD student, I feel more powerful than I ever imagined. 

You here in this room have helped me change the way I do science and the way I think about what is possible. You have empowered me and helped me build confidence that translates well beyond code. 

We are all here because we have been empowered by R as a tool and a community, but we can all probably think of others that are still feeling stranded and alone. We might work with them day-to-day. 

transition: So my question is â€” 

---
# How do we extend the #rstats culture?

???

How do we extend the #rstats culture?

How do we not only welcome more people to our community, but also export our ethos to other communities?

There are so many communities that could be enriched not only by R tools, but also R culture. 

&lt;!---
I think we can welcome them not only with the tools but with the culture. 

But we have to really understand 
Knowing that folks have a lot of responsibilities already and can feel isolated, and overwhelmed about coding, how do you welcome more people?

transition: I think about the way things work in environmental science â€”

R4DS fig minus hadley

We are experts on our study systems and theory, and our work has real impact. We emphasize communication, and by working with governments and stakeholders our efforts lead to on-the-ground changes in environmental policy. 

But in my mind there is this huge missing piece. There is a lot of individual struggle and reintenting the wheel because we don't have a common toolset or shared culture. 

transition: But this is what it could be like: 

---
R4DS complete


???

R tools and culture can really augment the important work environmental scientists are doing. 

Right now one of the biggest obstacles to getting here is that it that coding and data analysis is not valued in the environmental science. I said this before: we don't have a culture of teaching it and we do not even have a culture of talking about it.  

So to increase its value within environmental science, we need to increase its visibility. We need this to be something that people talk about and get excited about. 

And because we know how important community is, we can start with existing communities in science - the laboratory. 

If we can help labs operate like our #rstats community, they can become visible examples of how impactful it can be. They can influence their broader communities and it will have a ripple effect throughout environmental science. 

For the rest of the talk I'll share what this can look like in environmental science labs, and how we can replicate this with other teams. 

And I also want to underscore that although I am talking specifically about environmental science, these examples have relevance well beyond. We can all be leaders in our communities to welcome more people and teams to the welcoming power of R.

The ocean health index is a project to measure how healthy oceans are using the best available data and science. 

It is a really ambitious project. It set out to be the best approach that governments and policy makers around the world could use and build from, and indeed now it is used by the United Nations and twenty government and university groups around the world are using it as well. 

&lt;!---And there is no way that we could have so much reach and impact without #rstats and the ODS community.---&gt; 

transition: we didn't set out to be the best approach for what open data science could look like in environmental science â€”

---
nature paper

???

But when we stepped back and realized it was an important story to tell, it resonated with a lot of people. 

Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools is a retrospective of how we incrementally introduced #rstats and GitHub into our workflow over a period of four years. 

I won't go through all of this here but I want to give some highlights, particularly focusing on communication and collaboration. 

---
image of a house blueprint.

???

The Ocean Health Index is essentially a blueprint for measuring ocean health. 

A blueprint for a house would include walls, floors, and a roof, but houses around the world look different because of the materials available and local conditions. For example, houses look different in places with different amounts of snow, rain, or sun. 

The Ocean Health Index blueprint includes things that provides benefits to people, and that people can manage. So it includes the seafood we eat, jobs, tourism, the habitats that mitigate storm damage, and includes pressures affecting these benefits like climate change, as well as management policies that can counteract those pressures.

transition: 

---
screenshot Halpern et al. 2012

???

It took almost 4 years to develop this blueprint. 

At the same time we used it to calculate ocean health scores for all 220 coastal countries globally. 

This included almost 100 publicly data sets from the United Nations, World Bank, as well as synthesis studies and satellite data. 

The plan from the beginning was to repeat this global study each year, because the value of the OHI is not in doing it once, but in tracking change through time and acting upon the most pressing needs. 

So we had a plan for reproducibility, with attention to documentation. 

transition: but did these analyses using the tools we knew, like Luke Skywalker would have back on Dagobah. 

---
data_analysis_v2.xls
re:fwd:final data updated

???

Data processing was done with whatever tools different people knew. Most was in excel and a bit in R, with decisions documented in accompanying Word documents and emails. 

The programmer on the team would write models in whatever language best suited the data, and develop the models around whatever structure that data set was in. 

So the next year when we went to repeat the analysis, there was a lot of forensics and detective work to uncover what we had done the first time, and why. 

For that second year there was also turnover in the team: that was the year I joined and others moved on.  

Needless to say, we needed a better system. So here is what we do now. And again, this was over a four-year period, and we continue to iterate and improve.

- private "issues" repo for discussing methods
  - institutional memory, onboarding &amp; offboarding
- use RStudio &amp; GitHub (version control)

R norms

- all data prep, models, viz in R
- coding norms: `tidyverse` &amp; friends
- separate core "blueprint" models into R package `ohicore`
- separate local "tailorable" models into separate repos 
- data prep narratives in R Markdown

- welcoming people from the #rstats community (Karthik Ram, Hadley Wickham, Joe Cheng)
- trust &amp; willingness to learn together
- complementary/overlapping skillsets (not everyone codes)

???

Finally, I have to talk about our team. 

We were able to do all of this not only because of the tools, but because of the people involved. 

---
map? 

???

At this point, like I said, OHI is used by 20 groups around the world, and will be included in the UN's ocean indicators for the Sustainable Development Goals. 

This would not have been possible without #rstats. 

We are a streamlined team, able to onboard and offboard teammembers, we work well together, and we are able to iterate from past work and enable others. 

By 2018, I had been working for 5 years, not only to help with the global assessments, but to co-develop and lead the program for the independent groups. 

We had published the Nature paper, and could see it being well-received in some circles. 

But I wanted to actually help other teams do this themselves. 

transition: that's when I got the Mozilla Fellowship and started Openscapes.

Openscapes is a program to welcome environmental scientists to become champions for ODS.

Selection requirements: 

early career scientific leads (col 1)
- faculty
- lecturers
- program managers
- etc

- rising star, influential scientists that can also become ambassadors for ODS
- not yet engaged in open data science
- trust that I will not waste their time

I decided to focus on early career scientific leaders for a few reasons
But I was also having a lot of one-on-one conversations with colleagues of mine, friends from grad school who were now running their own labs. 

Early career PIs might not yet know about the Force. They may have struggled through like Luke in their PhDs, worked their butts off to secure faculty jobs, and are now leading their own teams. How about focusing on them?


---

Explicit statement:::::::
there's this aspect of open tools and the aspect of community. and we want this to be both. transition in the analogy: but once luke learned to use the force, he didn't go out adn defeat the empire on his his own. he needed his community. 

We need to focus on the tools and also on the community. 



&lt;!---
If we can do that in science â€” 

it's not tools, it's mindset. It's about seeing what's possible and being welcomed in. And I've been thinking about it not only from the data analysis and data science side, which is huge. 

transition: But in terms of welcoming environmental scientists, I've been thinking about it from the communication and culture side as well. 

---
R for science communication and culture

R has not only changed my analytical life, it's changed what's possible with science communication as well. and I think it can also change scientific culture; we can replicate/bring/remix what we have here in the #rstats community to environmental science, so that we put people first and can tackle these environmental issues. 

I'm going to tell you about an example of each: what's possible for env science and also for culture

---
nature paper screenshot

???

In a 2017 paper I led with my team, trying to be an example of what this can look like in science. 
we described how ODS helped us do better science in less time, how over the course of 4 years we incrementally introduced #rstats and github into our workflows and how it impacted the work we do and who uses it. And we identified 2 barriers: exposure and confidence. 

rstats is still not part of the culture of environmental science, so the 
There is a lack of exposure to what is possible, and a lack of confidence 

As a scientist, there are not a ton of pathways there, 

We found this on our own, had to seek it out. No one told us. Not a thing that is in the culture of science. 

transition: but what if it could be? so I want to give a two examples: what could this look like in environmental science? and how can we help welcome more scientists in?

---
# what does #rstats ethos look like in environmental science?

# how can we welcome others?  what if science prioritized community?

#



What's cool is that it opens up what communication can mean for science. It can make it more interactive, quicker. Science communication can mean publishing a peer-reviewed paper, it can mean talking with a journalist. It can mean tweeting, giving talks, etc. But now, with R, it can mean publishing books. It can mean 



???


how can we bring this welcoming and supportive culture to researchers in environmental science specifically who have such inmportant questions to answer but don't have the skillsets


I've been thinking a lot about having confidence with software leads to a more open and confident community. And how it's been this missing piece for scientists. What makes this happen is an investment in people and culture and community. 


transition:: what would it look like?

So that is my work to this point, I'm fundraising to be able to lead Openscapes full-time, and am co-leading our OHI internship program.

How do we motivate others?

Talk about and show your colleagues how R makes you

- a web designer
- a designer
- a community member
- a leader
